// Package usage builds the pages `mate usage` prints (mvp.md M5 task 27):
// the token ledger of a project, one task's model calls, its sessions, and
// `--why`, what a task's calls were spent on. cmd/mate's cmdUsage reads the
// flags, opens the database and prints what Write writes (CON-168). It also
// writes the head of `--why` into a crew's learning record when the crew
// closes (RecordAtClose, CON-130, moved here by CON-230).
//
// Every read of the timeline goes through internal/timeline/read; this
// package holds no SQL. `--why` reads through dashboard.Server, so the page
// and the dashboard's Task page can never disagree. No page adds a
// measurement of its own: every number is the ledger's or the projection's.
