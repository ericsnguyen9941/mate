// Package coreapi is the contract between mate's core and the UIs that
// drive it (CON-206): the console, Mate Office and Agent City. A UI reads
// the workspace through a LoadFunc and asks for an action through an
// ActionFunc; the core is whatever implements the two. Today the engine of
// internal/core does, inside the console's process: its Snapshot, and its
// Act for every UI's actions (CON-209). Once the core runs as a
// process of its own (CON-203), its engine and the client that reaches it
// over a socket import this package as well.
//
// It holds types, constants and errors only: no logic, no I/O, no network.
// That is what lets internal/ui/console import it, and why it imports
// nothing but the standard library and internal/query's read types
// (boundary_test.go keeps it that way).
