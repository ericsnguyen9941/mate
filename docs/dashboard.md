# Dashboard

This is the contract of `mate dashboard` and of `internal/dashboard` (docs/mvp.md M6, tasks 28 and 29).
Task 28 owns the server and this document; task 29 builds the three-tier UI against it.

The dashboard reads, and the one served by `mate console` can also act.
It opens `.mate/mate.db` with `db.OpenRead`, which takes no lock, so it runs beside an open console rather than instead of it.
It writes nothing itself. Its one write, `POST /api/actions` (section 7b, CON-141), hands a button press to the console's own action function, so a page and the console's action sheet run one code path; `mate dashboard` on its own has no console behind it and stays read-only.

```
mate dashboard [<workspace>] [--addr 127.0.0.1:7777] [--open] [--allow-remote]
```

`--addr` must be a loopback address unless `--allow-remote` is passed.
A workspace's timeline quotes every line the captain typed and names every path a crew touched, so putting it on a routable address has to be a decision rather than a default.
`--open` runs the platform opener (`open`, `xdg-open`, `rundll32`) on the URL; a machine with none of them says so and keeps serving.
The server prints its URL and runs until Ctrl+C.

## 1. Conventions

Every response carries two fields before anything else.

```json
{"generated_at": "2026-09-19T10:47:00.000000000Z", "last_event_id": 412}
```

`last_event_id` is `MAX(event.id)` over the whole workspace: the cursor for newly recorded events.
It is the number to hand back to `/api/events?since=`, so a page always polls from the exact id the data it is showing was computed at.

`generated_at` is when the snapshot behind the bytes was computed, not when they were served.
Workspace, project, model-call and diff responses are cached per `last_event_id`: while the id stands still they return the bytes already built, and when it moves every cached answer is dropped at once.
Crew task and Mate conversation responses are rebuilt on each request: running execution clocks and recording-heartbeat age can change without a new event. Usage is never extrapolated between harness records. The events endpoint is also uncached, and so is `/api/plugins` (section 3b), which reads files rather than the timeline.

A timestamp is the database's own string: RFC3339 with nanoseconds, in UTC (`db.TimeFormat`).
It is passed through and never reformatted, so a value on the page and a row in the database compare byte for byte.

A nullable number is `null`, never `0`.
A cost with no `pricing` row and a context percentage with no known context window are unknown, and docs/timeline.md's "a missing price is not a price of zero" is the same rule `mate usage` prints as `?`.

Token buckets are always this object.

```json
{"input": 32, "cache_read": 57690, "cache_write": 739, "output": 911, "thinking": 73, "total": 59372}
```

`total` is `input + cache_read + cache_write + output` and excludes `thinking`, which is exactly what `mate usage`'s TOTAL column and `v_now.tokens_today` sum.

A `ref` is a transcript locator - the file a fact was read out of and the byte offset inside it - and it is what makes every number on the page traceable back to the harness's own record.

```json
{"path": "/Users/x/.codex/sessions/2026/09/19/rollout-01a0b944.jsonl", "offset": 18422}
```

Errors are JSON with the same envelope.
An unknown project or crew is `404` and the reason names what was missing and what there is instead.

```json
{"generated_at": "…", "last_event_id": 412, "error": "no project \"nosuch\" in this workspace; it has shop, site"}
```

There is no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header of any kind.
The only page that reads this API is the one this server serves.

## 2. `GET /api/workspace`

Tier 1: one card per registered project.

`mate.harness` and `mate.running` come from the `actor` row (`harness`, `first_seen`, `gone_at`), which `v_now` has no column for; running means started and not stopped, where stopped is the current `mate.meta`'s `stopped_at`: a relaunch writes a meta without one and clears the `gone_at` of the life before it.
`mate.state`, `mate.since`, `mate.tokens_today` and `mate.context_pct` are `v_now`.
`crews_by_state` counts this project's crew actors by their `v_now` scene state, and a crew no projection has placed counts under `"unknown"` rather than being dropped.
`inbox_waiting` is the length of `box.Inbox` through `query.LoadBox`, the same loader and the same number the console's rail header shows.
`mode` is `store.Auto`: `"auto"` or `"manual"`.
`repos` names the project's repos in `project.yaml` order (`RepoNames`), and is empty when it has none or its `project.yaml` cannot be read; Agent City draws one tent per repo (section 12, CON-125).

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-19T10:47:00.000000000Z",
  "last_event_id": 412,
  "root": "/Users/x/work",
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "shop",
      "mode": "manual",
      "mate": {
        "harness": "claude",
        "running": true,
        "state": "idle",
        "since": "2026-09-19T10:46:40.000000000Z",
        "tokens_today": 57683,
        "context_pct": 29.2
      },
      "crews_by_state": {"waiting_review": 1},
      "inbox_waiting": 1,
      "repos": ["shop"]
    }
  ]
}
```

A project whose box could not be read still gets a card, with `"error"` saying why: one broken project must not blank the workspace.

## 3. `GET /api/projects/{project}`

Tier 2: the Mate above, the task table below, the inbox beside it.

`mate` is the card's block plus what the Mate has spent and what it last did.
There is no `task` row for a Mate - its turns belong to the project and not to any one task (docs/timeline.md) - so `turns`, `tokens` and `cost` are computed from `turn` directly, with the same all-zeroes-is-not-a-price guard `v_task_ledger` uses.
This is the same SQL `cmd/mate/usage.go`'s `mateLedgerRow` runs, and the unit tests compare the two number for number.
`last_turn` is `null` for a Mate that has taken no model call yet, and otherwise the full model-call object of section 4.
The project page links to `GET /api/projects/{project}/mate`. Its `exchanges`
are prompt-level interactions: one captain message, crew digest, or app prompt
and the Mate's response. Calls are grouped by `(session_id,
harness_turn_ref)`, so a prompt spanning several model calls appears once.
An inbound message with no call still appears with `model_calls: 0` and an
empty response. The prompt and response come from `sent.log` through the
`message` table; hook echoes are excluded as duplicate prompts. Selected
events and messages to Crew appear as human-readable activities. `turns` in
the Mate summary remains the count of model calls used for token accounting.
The UI shows newest exchanges first and reveals older ones in batches of 20.

`tasks` is every crew the project has ever recorded, open and closed, oldest spawn first: one row of `v_task_ledger` each, with the crew's current `v_now` state, target and detail hung on it, plus two things no view carries.
`tool_count` is `SUM(turn.tool_count)` for the crew, which the tier-3 ledger asks for and `v_task_ledger` has no column for.
`age_ms` is `closed_at - spawned_at` for a closed task and `now - spawned_at` for an open one.
`harness` is the crew's `actor.harness`, the same source the Mate card reads, so a page can name the harness of a recording whose telemetry carries no version.
`closed` is true when the task has a `close_state` or a `closed_at`.
`review` is set only for a reviewer crew, one `mate review` started and so left `review.meta` beside its report: the first line of the report's `## Verdict` section (`pass`, `changes-requested`, `incomplete`), or `pending` while there is none. A reviewer is closed `finished` or `failed` like any crew; `review` is what it concluded.
`failed_reason` is crew meta's `failed_reason=`, written when a spawn never came up; a crew closed with `crew stop --discard` is `failed` with none. A reviewer that delivered its Verdict is closed `reviewed` instead (CON-75).
`reviews` names the reviewers `mate review` started for the task (crew meta `reviews=`, or a reviewer's `review.meta` naming the crew); `review_of` is the task a reviewer row reviewed; `tokens_with_reviews` is `tokens.total` plus every reviewer's total, so a task's cost with its reviews is one number (CON-75). The Office's cabinet peek reads it.

`repo` is the repo the crew worked in: crew meta `repo=`, or the project's sole repo, resolved through `project.yaml` as `mate crew spawn` does (`CrewRepo`); absent when that does not resolve, for a crew whose repo has left `project.yaml` or a project whose `project.yaml` cannot be read (CON-125).

`role` is what the task was for: `review` for a reviewer crew (it has `review.meta`), `scout` for a scout (crew meta `kind=scout`, or a brief with `## Deliverable` for a crew spawned before `kind` was recorded), else `ship`.

`agents` is the kinds of agent the crew delegated to, first use first and each once: the `agent` of its `tool.called` events (docs/timeline.md), which is Claude's `subagent_type` - a project's `.claude/agents/<name>.md` such as `backend-reviewer`, or a built-in such as `Explore`, as written. Finding them reads every `tool.called` payload, so the server keeps them in memory, reads only the events past the highest id it has seen, and starts over when that id goes backwards (a `mate reindex`) (CON-126). Absent for a crew that delegated to none, or only to agents of no named kind. Events ingested before the field existed carry no `agent`; `mate reindex` rebuilds them from the transcripts (CON-124).

`inbox` is `box.Inbox` flattened through `query.LoadBox`, oldest first, the same rows in the same order the console's rail draws.
A failed box read leaves `inbox` empty and puts the reason in `inbox_error` rather than failing the page.

## 3b. `GET /api/plugins?project=<p>`

The apps a project's Mate receives from `.mate/plugins.yaml` (docs/plans/plugins-and-office-2026-10-12.md), as validated local metadata, for Mate Office's Apps block (section 11).
It reads `plugins.yaml` and the workspace packages' manifests through `internal/plugin` on every request and is not cached: an edit to the file is not an event.
It writes nothing, calls no MCP server or tracker, and runs no command; opening a link is the browser's job, never the server's.
`project` is required; a missing or unknown one is a 404 that names it.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-19T10:47:00.000000000Z",
  "last_event_id": 412,
  "project": "shop",
  "apps": [
    {"instance": "linear-work", "name": "Linear", "status": "configured", "harness": "claude",
     "open": {"title": "Open Linear", "url": "https://linear.app/acme/team/SHOP"},
     "mcp": {"name": "linear-work", "type": "http"}, "skills": ["workflow"], "error": null}
  ]
}
```

One row per enabled workspace instance (plus legacy bindings for this project),
in `plugins.yaml` order. The project parameter selects the Mate/harness status;
it does not limit a workspace installation to that project.
`name` is the manifest's; `open.url` is the package's link with this project's config substituted, and it is the only URL in the answer - the MCP endpoint, a stdio command and binding config stay out.
`mcp` is `null` for a package without a server, `open` for one without a link, and `skills` lists skill names, `[]` when none.

`status` is one of three words, and each is about configuration only:

| `status` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `configured` | the configuration is valid and the Mate's harness can take it |
| `configuration error` | `error` says what is wrong, with the file, instance and project it is in |
| `harness unsupported` | valid, but the app has an MCP server and the Mate's harness cannot be given one; `error` says why |

Whether the Mate is logged in to an app, or its tools answer, is unknown here: there is no auth, connected or ready field, and a valid file is not evidence of either.
The place to check is `/mcp` in the Mate's Claude pane.

`harness` is the running Mate's (`actor.harness`, section 9); for a Mate that is not running it is `workspace.yaml`'s `defaults.mate_harness`, which a new start uses, and `unknown` when that is empty.
Whether a harness can be given MCP servers is the harness profile's answer, not the dashboard's: the server asks `Deps.PluginHarness(kind)`, which `mate dashboard` and the console's dashboard wire to the profile's `MCPConfig` capability (`harness.Capabilities`), so `internal/dashboard` names no harness (the harness ratchet, `internal/harness/ratchet_test.go`).
A harness whose `MCPConfig` is not verified answers with the capability's `Reason`, which is the app's `error`; a kind the binary does not have answers that it is unknown.
The same capability decides the launch: a Mate launch carrying MCP servers on a harness without it is refused with `ErrMCPUnsupported`, so the dashboard and `mate mate start` cannot disagree.
An `unknown` harness, or a server started without that seam, calls no app `harness unsupported`.
Only an app with an MCP server can be `harness unsupported`; a skills-only or open-only app stays `configured`.
While any app is unsupported the Mate will not start, so a `configured` app beside it carries an `error` saying so.

A broken `plugins.yaml` is an answer, not a 500.
A problem in the file as a whole (YAML that does not parse, a wrong `apiVersion`) is `200` with `"apps": []` and the problem in a top-level `error`.
A problem located at one instance is also in the top-level `error`, and every row of the project says `configuration error`: the one at fault carries the problem, the others that the Mate will not start with this file, because a Mate start refuses the whole file (`internal/spawn`).
Those rows are read from the file without validating it, so their `name` is the instance id and they carry no `open`, `mcp` or skills.
A valid file has no top-level `error`.

## 3c. `GET /api/board?days=<n>`

The Office's daily board (CON-84): one column per calendar day, oldest first, for the workspace and for each project.
`days` defaults to 14 and is capped at 90; the board offers 7, 14 and 30.
A day is the server clock's zone, named in `zone`, not UTC: `v_now.tokens_today` and the top bar's `Today` are a UTC day, so the two disagree in the hours the zones do.
The response is not cached, because the window moves at midnight whether or not an event does.

Each day carries:

- `tokens`: the token buckets of every `turn` that started that day (`started_at`, else `ended_at`), Mate and crews alike; `mate_tokens` and `crew_tokens` split `tokens.total` by the actor's kind. The board counts in tokens only and has no cost.
- `spawned`: tasks spawned that day by `role` (`ship`, `scout`, `review`, as in section 3).
- `closed`: ships and scouts closed that day by final state: `finished`, `discarded` (a `failed` task with no `failed_reason`), `didnt_start` (one with), or any other `close_state` as it is. There is no `merged`: the timeline sees only the merges mate made itself, and a PR merged on GitHub is not one of them, so a merged count would read as work not landing.
- `reviews`: reviewers closed that day by verdict: `pass`, `changes-requested`, `incomplete`, or `no_verdict` for one closed without a Verdict. The Office calls `changes-requested` rework.
- `incidents`: incidents opened that day by `kind` (`stale`, `runtime_lost`, `wedged`, `budget`). `budget` is a crew or the project crossing its token budget. A harness running out of quota is not recorded on the timeline yet (CON-85), so the board cannot count it.

`total` is every project summed. A project whose tasks could not be read carries `error`, and its tokens and incidents are still counted.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "…", "last_event_id": 412, "days": 14, "zone": "+07:00",
  "dates": ["2026-10-03", "…", "2026-10-16"],
  "total": [{"date": "2026-10-16", "tokens": {"input": 0, "cache_read": 0, "cache_write": 0, "output": 0, "thinking": 0, "total": 0},
             "mate_tokens": 0, "crew_tokens": 0, "spawned": {"ship": 5, "review": 7}, "closed": {"finished": 6, "discarded": 1},
             "reviews": {"pass": 5, "changes-requested": 2}, "incidents": {"budget": 7, "runtime_lost": 2}}],
  "projects": [{"name": "shop", "days": ["…one per date…"]}]
}
```

## 3d. `GET /api/news?project=<p>`

Every news a headless Mate opened for the captain (`mate news open`, `mate/news.jsonl`, CON-78), closed ones included, for Mate Office's captain drawer (section 11, CON-97).
Without `project` it answers for every project in workspace order; an unknown `project` is a 404 that names it.
It folds the log through `matehost.LoadNews` on every request and is not cached: the REPL marking a news seen or the captain answering it writes the log, not an event.
It writes nothing: reading a news here does not mark it seen.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "…", "last_event_id": 412,
  "projects": [
    {"project": "shop", "logged": true, "news": [
      {"id": 3, "crew": "buybtn", "kind": "decision", "title": "Checkout URL", "context": ["buybtn asked twice"],
       "question": "Which page?", "options": [{"key": "a", "text": "express", "recommended": true}],
       "status": "working", "opened_at": "…", "at": "…", "seen_at": "…", "answer": "[a] express", "answered_at": "…",
       "notes": [{"at": "…", "text": "CI is green"}]}
    ]},
    {"project": "infra", "logged": false, "news": []}
  ]
}
```

`news` is newest move first (`at`: opened, updated, answered, closed; being seen is not a move).
`status` is the log's: `new` (the captain has not opened it), `waiting` (opened, not answered), `working` (answered, the Mate is on it), `done`, `dropped`.
`seen_at` is when a `new` news was last opened and `answered_at` when the last answer was given; both are absent when that never happened, or happened before the log recorded it.
`logged` is false when the Mate has no news log, which is not the same answer as a log with nothing in it; a log that cannot be read is `logged: true` with `error` and no news.

## 4. `GET /api/projects/{project}/tasks/{crew}`

Tier 3 leads with the current activity, up to three evidence-linked findings,
prompt-level timelines and the segments using the most tokens. Model calls,
status lines, questions and the branch remain available as supporting evidence.

`ledger` is the same task object as tier 2's row.

`?view=summary` answers with `ledger`, `status_lines` and `questions` only - no `turns`, `branch` or `performance`, which are most of the full answer's time and bytes (CON-126).

`turns` is one object per model call, oldest first.
`trigger_kind` is the `kind` of the event named by `turn.trigger_event_id`, joined on because a page showing a bare id would be showing the reader a number they cannot read.
`duration_ms` is `ended_at - started_at`, and `0` for a turn that has not ended.
`context_pct` is `100 * context_tokens_after / pricing.context_window` for that turn's model, `null` when the model has no priced window.
`ref` is the turn's own `ref_path`/`ref_offset`.

`status_lines` is the crew's `status.appended` events, with `verb`, `text` and `line` read out of the payload docs/timeline.md section 4 documents.

`questions` is the `question` table for this crew.
The answer's text is not on that table - it records which event answered, not what the answer said - so it is read from the answering event: `message.text` when a `message` row exists for it, otherwise that event's own payload, whose `text` is the answer verbatim.
`answered_by` is the answering actor's name.
`waited_ms` is `null` while a question is still waiting, which is not the same as having waited zero.

`branch` is the task's recorded branch and whether git still has it.
A branch that is gone is not an error: the crew was torn down and its work landed or was discarded, and `reason` says so.

### Crew performance projection

The task response also carries `performance` (`version: crew-observability-v1`).
The observer records `telemetry.*` facts in the derived event store; this read-only
projection uses their native prompt/execution identities and the existing ledger
for billed token buckets. It never adds native response usage to ledger usage.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `tokens`, `model_calls` | Exactly the Crew ledger's bucket totals and model-call count. |
| `prompt_turns` | Native prompt ID scoped to its session, actual prompt and source locator, prompt timing, bucket totals, call count and `segment_ids`. A missing prompt ID leaves that call isolated. |
| `segments` | Contiguous activity in call order, with `kind` from the work vocabulary (`research`, `instructions`, `write_code`, `edit_code`, `review`, `test`, `coordination`, `wait`, `response`, `mixed`, `unknown`), concrete `label`/`target`, `call_ids`, `execution_ids`, buckets, nullable elapsed/tool-union/invocation time, repeat count and versioned classification rule. Each ledger call is assigned once. A running execution before usage arrives can have zero attributed calls. |
| `current_segment_id`, `top_segment_ids` | Current observed work when identifiable, and up to five segments ranked by total tokens. A completed run has no current segment. |
| `top_output_segment_ids`, `top_output_call_ids` | Up to five segments and up to five ledger calls ranked by output + thinking, ties by id. Total tokens mostly rank the longest context; these rank what the model itself wrote. |
| `findings`, `top_finding_ids` | Versioned polling, repeated-read, repeated-error/repair, failed-command, long-execution, output/context and decision-wait observations. The first screen shows at most three. Findings include explanatory text, confidence, count, source evidence, related calls/segments/executions and a review suggestion. Their call sets can overlap; do not add their tokens together. |
| `executions` | Native commands and observed tools, with exact command/cwd, native process/wrapper links when known, start/end, nullable duration/exit/output measurements, output hash/preview, polling and wrapper flags, and source locator. Wrapper success never overrides a nested native failure. |
| `processes` | One process per session identity, actual job command when known, execution/poll IDs, unchanged/progress/unknown-output poll counts and tokens of the associated polling calls. Polls are not additional builds/tests. |
| `time` | Prompt elapsed, union of tool spans, sum of invocation durations, union of decision waits, and time not explained by measured tool/wait spans. Lanes overlap. None is called API latency or total thinking time. Missing measurements are `null`. Legacy synthesized `thinking` actions are excluded. |
| `recent_tokens`, `recent_window_ms` | Actual usage reported in the last five minutes, never an interpolated burn rate. |
| `freshness` | Separate last observed/ingested/usage stamps, age, stale flag, adapter capabilities and explicit missing-data reasons. `telemetry_cursor.observed_at` supplies the observer heartbeat even when no transcript bytes changed. |
| `profile` | Recorded launch snapshot, if available: repo revision/dirty state, requested model/effort, harness and configured document hashes/sizes. Historical runs without a snapshot remain unknown. |
| `runtime`, `observed_inputs`, `progress` | Actually reported model/effort/harness version, actually observed instruction-input hashes/bytes, and file-change evidence. Configured files and observed inputs are distinct; bytes are not exact billed token attribution. |
| `overview` | The Crew-level work overview: the same categories as `prompt_turns[].overview` summed over every prompt by the same classifier. Category `tokens` add up to `tokens` and `model_calls` to `model_calls`; `sequence` is empty (the per-prompt sequences carry order) and `coverage` ends with "across N prompts". |
| `loops` | How often the Crew repeated itself: `chains` (polling findings), `polls`/`unchanged_polls`/`progress_polls`/`unknown_polls`/`processes_polled` from `processes`, `poll_calls`/`poll_tokens` from `wait` segments (`null` when there is none), `repeated_reads`/`repeated_errors`/`repair_loops` finding counts and `segment_repeats` (Σ `repeat_count`). `measured` is true only with native execution status; otherwise every process number is 0 and `coverage` says polling chains are not measurable while repeated reads and retries still are. |

Finding/process `tokens` is `null` if no model-call link is confirmed. A native
execution with no confirmed wrapper parent remains visible in its prompt's
execution lane; nearby timestamps do not establish token attribution. Repeated
reads require identical query/range and output hash, and reset after a recorded
file change or changed output. Retries with intervening file changes are shown
as repair sequences; missing file state is never treated as unchanged code.
Detector thresholds live in `diagnostics.Options` and are exercised by numeric
and false-positive fixtures.

### Work overview for every prompt

Both `performance.prompt_turns[].overview` for Crew and
`exchanges[].overview` for Mate use the same projection. The collapsed prompt
shows a short summary and work-type labels; opening it shows the observed
sequence, usage by type, execution time and source evidence.

The types include research/inspection, writing files, editing files, review,
tests/builds, coordination, waiting/polling and reading instructions.
Classification uses actual tool operations, literal commands and native file
changes. A request to run tests does not establish that tests ran. An edit is
not automatically called a bug fix. Unclassified work remains explicit.

`overview.categories` contain `kind`, `label`, `model_calls`,
`execution_count`, nullable `tokens`/`elapsed_ms`, related call/segment/execution
IDs and self-contained command/source `evidence`. Each model call belongs to
exactly one category. A call covering several kinds belongs to `mixed`; its
usage is not divided among tools. The other categories can still show those
tools as evidence with unattributed usage. Category token buckets add up to
the prompt ledger. Execution intervals can overlap across categories.

`overview.sequence` retains successive observed types, including returns such
as test → edit → test. One operation containing several types becomes one
mixed step; it does not invent an order among parallel tools. `rule` identifies
the classifier and `coverage` explains the available evidence.

Mate grouping uses confirmed native response aliases when a legacy call has
no prompt ID. Otherwise that call stays isolated. Native prompts and their
work remain visible before the first usage record; message-only prompts show
an empty overview until activity arrives. The overview adds no model calls.

## 4b. `GET /api/projects/{project}/history?since=<RFC3339>`

Every crew's `status_lines` and decision `questions`, as section 4 carries them, from `since` on, by crew name: `{ "project", "since", "crews": { "<crew>": { "status_lines": [...], "questions": [...] } } }`. A crew with neither since then is absent. Two queries for the whole project, where section 4 takes two a crew, so Agent City's tent reads a week of a busy project in one request (section 12, CON-127).

`since` is required; a missing or unparsable one is a 400. The answer is cached per `last_event_id` like section 2's, keyed by the query, so a reader that keeps `since` fixed for the day is answered from the cache.

## 5. `GET /api/projects/{project}/tasks/{crew}/turns/{turn}`

One turn opened: the turn itself, its tool calls, and the story rows recorded inside it.

`actions` is the `action` rows of that turn, oldest first.
`action` carries no locator of its own - the schema puts `ref_path`/`ref_offset` on `event` - so each action's `ref` comes from the `tool.called` event it was written beside, through `action.event_id`.
`duration_ms` and `ok` are `null` for a call whose result the transcript did not carry.
`actions` can be longer than the turn's `tool_count`: the count is the calls the harness made, while `action` also holds the synthesised `thinking` rows the ingest writes for a busy stretch no call explains (docs/timeline.md section 4).
A UI that draws them should say which is which by the tool name.

`events` is `v_story` filtered to `turn_id`, in exactly the shape and field order `mate events` prints as JSON lines: `id`, `at`, `project`, `kind`, `actor`, `actor_kind`, `subject`, `task`, `turn`, `cause`, `cause_kind`, `payload`, `ref`, `ref_offset`.
It is produced by `timeline.Story`, the same function the CLI calls, so the two cannot drift.

A turn id belonging to another crew is a `404`: a link built from one page must not render under another page's heading.

Turn ids contain `#` (`crew:shop:buybtn#<session>#turn#20`), so the path segment must be percent-encoded - `encodeURIComponent` in the UI.
An unescaped `#` makes the browser send only the part before it and treat the rest as a fragment, which arrives here as a turn id that matches nothing.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-19T10:47:00.000000000Z",
  "last_event_id": 412,
  "project": "shop",

    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "id": 301,
      "at": "2026-09-19T10:46:01.000000000Z",
      "project": "shop",

      "ref_offset": 19110
    }
  ]
}
```

## 6. `GET /api/projects/{project}/tasks/{crew}/diff`

The bottom of the task page: `mate diff <project> <crew>`, verbatim.

The CLI's own `crewDiffText` produces it, so the page and the terminal can never disagree about what a branch contains.
A branch git no longer has returns `200` with an empty `text` and a `reason`, not an error, for the same reason the CLI says it plainly: a crew whose branch was deleted is a crew whose work landed or was discarded.
A diff that fails for any other reason answers the same way - the rest of the task page is still true, and a `500` here would take it down with the branch.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-19T10:47:00.000000000Z",
  "last_event_id": 412,
  "project": "shop",
  "crew": "buybtn",
  "branch": "mate/buybtn",
  "exists": true,
  "text": "0d2d20d docs: add Buy link\n\ndiff --git a/README.md b/README.md\n…"
}
```

## 7. `GET /api/events?since=<id>&wait=<seconds>&project=<p>`

The long poll that keeps a page current without a refresh button.

It returns as soon as an event with `id > since` exists.
Otherwise it waits up to `wait` seconds, polling the database once a second, and then returns an empty list - an empty answer is the honest "still nothing", and the client polls again with the same cursor.
`wait` is clamped to 25 seconds, which is under every default proxy and browser idle timeout a local page can meet.
`since` defaults to 0, which returns the whole story.
`project` is optional; without it the story of every project is returned, merged and sorted by `(at, id)`.

`events` are `v_story` rows through `timeline.Story`, the same shape and field order `mate events` prints.

`now` are the `v_now` rows of the actors that moved, so one call refreshes both the story and the scene.
`v_now` has no "changed since" of its own, so which actors moved is read off `transition` - the table the view's scene columns already come from - as the distinct actors with a transition whose `event_id > since`.

`timeline_stale`, present only when there is something to say, lists the projects whose ingest has failed every pass since `since` (wall clock), with the latest `error` on one line (CON-139). Everything served for such a project is behind its files from then on. Only the console's dashboard knows: it is the timeline's writer. `mate dashboard` on its own never sends the field.

This endpoint is not cached: it answers "what happened after the id you hold", which depends on the caller's cursor. Crew task snapshots are also uncached because heartbeat age and running durations advance without events; the remaining endpoints use the event generation cache.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-19T10:47:00.000000000Z",
  "last_event_id": 412,
  "project": "shop",
  "since": 400,
  "events": [{"id": 401, "at": "…", "project": "shop", "kind": "turn.ended", "…": "…"}],
  "now": [
    {
      "actor_id": "crew:shop:buybtn",
      "actor": "buybtn",
      "actor_kind": "crew",
      "project": "shop",
      "state": "waiting_review",
      "since": "2026-09-19T10:46:12.000000000Z",
      "target": "mate",
      "detail": "",
      "tokens_today": 57774,
      "context_pct": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## 7b. Actions (CON-141)

`GET /api/projects/{project}/actions` is the console's action sheet for the project's Mate and for each open crew, in the sheet's order and words.

```json
{"generated_at": "…", "last_event_id": 412, "project": "shop",
 "mate": [{"action": "start", "label": "Start mate", "available": false, "reason": "Mate is recorded running"},
          {"action": "stop", "label": "Stop mate…", "available": true, "confirm": "Stop the Mate of shop? …"}],
 "crews": {"buybtn": [{"action": "merge", "label": "Merge…", "available": true, "confirm": "Merge mate/buybtn into main and finish crew buybtn? …"}]}}
```

Availability is `internal/query`'s (`query.ActionAvailability`), read from the console's own snapshot - the one answer the console's sheet shows too - and `reason` is why a button cannot run.
`confirm` is the question a page asks before a destructive action; a button without one runs at once.
The Mate has start (or `resume`, or `onboard` to create it), `stop`, `restart_mate`, `mode` and `clear_composer`; a crew has `stop`, `restart_crew`, `merge` (only once it reported `wait-mate`) and `diff`, which a page reads from section 6 rather than posting.
The console's `Repair binding…` is not offered: repairing a crew is not wired behind it.
A dashboard with no console behind it answers `read_only` with the reason and no buttons.

`POST /api/actions` with `{"action": "stop", "project": "shop", "crew": "buybtn"}` (`crew` only for a crew's action) presses one.
The press is checked again against a fresh snapshot, then run by the console's `consoleAction`; the answer is `{"line": "…"}`, the console's own one line.

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | it ran; `line` says what happened |
| `400` | an action not offered for that row (`remove_project`, `repair`, …) or a body that is not one |
| `403` | no console behind this dashboard, or an `Origin` that is not this server's |
| `404` | an unknown project, or a crew that is not open |
| `409` | the action cannot run now (its `reason`), or another action is still running on the same Mate or crew |
| `415` | a body that is not `application/json` |
| `422` | the service ran and refused or failed; `error` is its message verbatim |

There is no authentication (CON-141 leaves that to the LAN): anyone who can open the page can press a button.
The JSON body and the `Origin` check only keep another site open in the same browser from pressing one, since a cross-site form cannot send JSON without a preflight this server never answers.
An action runs to its end even when the page that pressed it goes away.

### `GET /api/now?project=<p>`

The whole scene in one call: every `v_now` row, in the shape of `/api/events`' `now`, sorted by `actor_id`.
`/api/events` only carries the rows of actors that moved since a cursor, so a page that draws everyone at once - Mate Office, section 11 - would otherwise have to poll from 0 and replay the story.
`project` is optional; an unknown project is a 404 that names it.
An actor with no scene row yet is simply absent, and a page reads its tokens today as unknown rather than 0.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-19T10:47:02.114Z",
  "last_event_id": 1840,
  "now": [
    {"actor_id": "crew:shop:buybtn", "actor": "buybtn", "actor_kind": "crew", "project": "shop", "state": "waiting_review", "since": "2026-09-19T10:46:24.375000000Z", "target": "mate", "detail": "handback", "tokens_today": 0, "context_pct": null, "context_tokens": null}
  ]
}
```

## 8. `GET /` - the UI

`/` serves an embedded `embed.FS` rooted at `internal/dashboard/ui/`: plain HTML and JS, no build step and no CDN, so the dashboard is a single binary that works with no network at all.
Task 28 ships a placeholder that lists these endpoints and fetches `/api/workspace` to prove the wiring; task 29 owns everything else under that directory.

## 9. What is read directly rather than through a view

The views are the contract, and these are the five places they do not reach.
Each is named here because a later change to a view should absorb them rather than leave two ways to ask the same question.

1. `actor.harness`, `actor.first_seen` and `actor.gone_at`, for a Mate card's harness and whether it is running. `v_now` carries neither.
2. `SUM(turn.tool_count)` per actor, for the tier-3 ledger's tool-call count. `v_task_ledger` has no such column.
3. The Mate's own turn count, token buckets and cost, from `turn`. `v_task_ledger` joins `task`, and a Mate has no task row.
4. `turn`, `action`, `question` and `message` themselves, for the turn timeline: the views summarise a task, they do not enumerate what happened inside it.
5. `transition`, for which actors moved since an event id, because `v_now` is a snapshot with no history in it.

`v_now`'s `context_pct` is read from the view directly rather than through `scene.Now`, which selects only the eight columns `mate events --scene` prints.

## 10. The UI

Task 29's page, under `internal/dashboard/ui/`: `index.html`, `app.css`, `app.js` and `humanize.js`.
Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript loaded as classic scripts - no build step, no framework, no CDN and no off-origin request of any kind.
`internal/dashboard/ui_assets_test.go` walks every embedded file and fails the build on a `<script src=`, `<link href=`, `<img src=`, `fetch(`, `url(`, `@import` or `new WebSocket/EventSource/Worker` pointing anywhere but this origin, and on any bare `http://` or `https://` outside a comment.

### Routes

The three tiers are one document, routed on the hash, so a link to a task survives a copy-paste and the back button works.

| Hash | Tier |
| --- | --- |
| `#/` | workspace: one card per project - mode, the Mate's harness, running/stopped, scene state, since, tokens today, context %, crews counted by state, `N waiting` |
| `#/p/<project>` | project: the Mate panel, the task table (filter chips, default `open`), the inbox beside it |
| `#/p/<project>/mate` | Mate: prompt-level questions, replies, decisions and outcomes; filter by captain, crew or system |
| `#/p/<project>/t/<crew>` | task: the ledger header, the turn timeline, status lines, questions, the branch diff |

`#/p/<project>/t/<crew>/usage` is the task tier exactly as above, then scrolls once to the token consumption card (`data-answer="tokens"`) when it has rendered; the crumbs and links keep producing the plain task hash, and a URL without the suffix does not scroll.
Mate Office links to it.

A project or crew name is `encodeURIComponent`-ed into the hash, and a turn id into the path of `/turns/{turn}` (section 5).

### Live update

One loop, one request at a time: `GET /api/events?since=<the last_event_id the page's data was built at>&wait=20`, plus `&project=<p>` on tiers 2 and 3.
On any `events` or `now` the page re-fetches only the endpoint the current tier reads and re-renders, keeping scroll position, the expanded turns and keyboard focus.
Because the API is cached per `last_event_id` and the page always polls from the id its own bytes carry, a re-fetch after an event that changed nothing it shows costs the server a cache hit.

The header links to Mate Office (section 11), opened on the crew drawer for a task page, the Mate drawer for a Mate page, and the whole floor otherwise, and beside it to Agent City (section 12).
The header carries the state as words: `live · HH:MM:SS` after every answered poll, `stale · <reason>` when one fails, where the reason is the API's own `reason` or, for a transport failure, "the dashboard is not answering".
A failed poll retries every 3 seconds rather than spinning.

One thing the `since` contract does not cover: `mate reindex` deletes and re-inserts every event, so `MAX(event.id)` can go *backwards*.
A page holding a cursor from before a rebuild would poll a dead id for ever while reporting `live`, so the page treats a `last_event_id` lower than its own cursor as a rebuild, takes the server's number and re-fetches.

### Numbers

`humanize.js` re-implements `internal/query`'s `HumanizeTokens` and `HumanizeCost` - `523`, `96.3k`, `1.2M`, `$0.12`, `$1.2k` - including Go's round-half-to-even, which JavaScript's own `toFixed` does not do (`$0.125` is `$0.12` in Go and `$0.13` in `toFixed`).
`TestUIHumanizeMatchesGo` builds a table of ~900 cases from the Go functions, sweeping every boundary plus a deterministic spread, and replays it through the page's own file in node when the machine has one.
Durations (`840ms`, `6.2s`, `1m7s`, `2h04m`, `3d 4h`) are the page's own: the console's `shortDuration` answers a different question and rounds a minute and seven seconds down to `1m`.

A `null` cost or context percentage renders `?`, never `0` - the same answer `mate usage` prints.
A timestamp is shown as a local clock time with the database's own RFC3339 string on hover, so a value on the page and a row in the database stay comparable.
Every turn, action, status line and event carries its `ref` as a `path:offset` tooltip.

### Vocabulary and colour

The state words are `internal/timeline/scene`'s own (`at_desk_working`, `waiting_review`, `walking_to_ceo`, …) and the inbox's phrases are the console's (`needs an answer`, `stuck, quiet too long`, `agent gone`, `over budget`, `send wedged`), so the TUI and the browser describe the same workspace in the same words.
Every state word is a glyph plus the word: colour is never the only difference between a crew working and a crew blocked.

Colour is defined once as tokens on `:root` and redefined under `prefers-color-scheme: dark`; the dark series steps are chosen for the dark surface rather than flipped.
The four token buckets are a stacked meter in a fixed slot order - input, cache read, cache write, output - assigned to the bucket and not to its size, with a 2px surface gap between segments and a legend that always shows the numbers.
Context % is a single-hue meter, because it is one magnitude against one window.
Below 720px the tables collapse to one card per row and the page does not scroll sideways.

## 11. Mate Office

A second face on the same API, served at `/office/` from `internal/dashboard/ui/office/`: `index.html`, `office.css`, `office.js`, plus `../humanize.js` shared with the admin UI.
It draws the workspace as an office from the owner's "Mate Office" design: a hallway with the captain's desk and the crews standing in it, and one room per project with the Mate at the big desk, a desk per open crew and a filing cabinet of closed tasks.
A room's door light is the project's, not only its Mate's: `stopped` when the Mate is not running, `running` while the Mate or any open crew is at work (a Mate in any state but `idle`, `asleep`, `blocked` or `gone`; a crew `arriving`, `at_desk_working`, `walking_to_ceo` or `leaving`), and otherwise `idle 3h`, the age of the latest scene `since` among the Mate and its open crews.
The nameplate of each room shows how many tokens that project has consumed: the Mate's own turns plus every task, open and closed, which is the total line of `mate usage`.
A room whose project page has not been read, or whose sum is missing a part, shows `?`.
It holds to every rule of section 10 - same origin only, text set with `textContent`, no build step, `null` shown as `?` - and its only request that is not a GET is an action button's `POST /api/actions` (section 7b).
Its view switch is `Office | City | Admin`.

| Hash | Opens |
| --- | --- |
| `#mate/<project>` | the Mate drawer: current activity, facing, last turn, mode, usage, the crews in the room |
| `#crew/<project>/<crew>` | the crew drawer: state and why, current activity, step, target, usage with a `Usage details` button, the task, a link to the admin timeline |
| `#cabinet/<project>` | the filing cabinet: closed tasks by age, each with its final state and a `Usage details` button under it |
| `#board` | the daily board: tokens, work done and incidents by day (section 3c) |
| `#captain` | the captain drawer: the news every Mate sent the captain, with where each stands (section 3d) |

The Mate drawer and the crew drawer each have an `Actions` block after `Current activity`: section 7b's buttons, in the console sheet's order. A button that cannot run is disabled with its reason under it. A destructive one opens a question with `Cancel`, where the focus lands, and the action's own button; only that one runs it. While an action runs every button waits, and the one running says `Running …`. The answer is the console's one line, or the service's error in its own words, and the page re-reads the floor and the buttons at once. `Diff` shows the crew's branch (section 6) under the buttons and hides it on a second press. A dashboard with no console says it is read-only instead of drawing buttons.

`Usage details` is a link to `../#/p/<project>/t/<crew>/usage` (names `encodeURIComponent`-ed) that opens the admin page in a new tab (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener"`); the Mate has none.

The Mate drawer ends with an Apps block from `/api/plugins?project=<p>` (section 3b), read only while that drawer is open: one line per app with its name, its status chip and, only for a `configured` app with an `http(s)` `open.url`, an `Open` link to that URL in a new tab (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener"`).
A `configuration error` shows its message as text; when any app has an MCP server one line says "Login and tool status: check /mcp in the Mate's Claude pane", because the page does not know.
A project with no apps has no block, and a failed read shows `Apps: ?` while the rest of the drawer still draws.
It is a view, not a place to manage apps: no form, button or request beyond that GET.

The hallway holds a whiteboard, `Daily board`, that opens `#board`: section 3c's numbers in a wide drawer, the whole workspace or one project, over 7, 14 or 30 days (the choice is remembered in the browser).
`Today so far` sets today against the average of the days before it in the window - tokens, tasks opened, done, dropped (discarded and didn't start), approved reviews, rework (reviews that requested changes), incidents and over budget - with the change coloured by which way is better; today is still running, so a lower number before evening is not news.
`By day` is one row per day, newest first, with a token bar split into Mate and crews and each count's breakdown as its tooltip.
The board reads `/api/board` only while it is open, and again when an event lands.

The captain's desk in the hallway (on a phone, the captain's card) is a button that opens `#captain`; under the inbox line it says how much news is unread or waiting for an answer.
The drawer lists every Mate's news, newest first: `Waiting on you` (unread and read-not-answered), `The Mate is on it` (answered), and `Earlier` (closed and dropped, the latest ten with `Show all`).
Each row names its project, crew and `#id` with a status chip; opening it shows the question, context, options, when it was sent, read and answered, the captain's answer and the Mate's updates.
It is a view: a news is answered in its Mate's REPL, and nothing here marks one seen. A project whose log cannot be read shows `<project>: news ?` with the reason as its tooltip.

Reads: `/api/workspace`, `/api/now`, `/api/projects/{p}` per project, `/api/news` (again on every quiet poll, because news moves without an event), and for an open drawer `/api/projects/{p}/mate` plus `/api/plugins?project=<p>`, `/api/projects/{p}/tasks/{crew}`, or `/api/board?days=<n>`.
It long-polls `/api/events` from the lowest `last_event_id` it holds (`wait=5` with a drawer open, 20 otherwise) and re-reads the floor when anyone moved.
A `timeline_stale` in the answer turns the live pill `stale` with `timeline <p> since <time>: <error>` until an answer without it.

The typefaces are the design's - Geist, Geist Mono and Bricolage Grotesque - as latin WOFF2 subsets under `ui/office/fonts/`.
All three are under the SIL Open Font License 1.1; the licences are embedded from `internal/dashboard/fontlicenses/` and served at `/office/fonts/licenses/<Family>-OFL.txt`, kept outside `ui/` because they name web addresses.

`internal/dashboard/ui_office_test.go` proves the page, its assets, the fonts and their licences are served from the binary and tests `/api/now`; it runs `ui_office_test.cjs`, which drives `office.js` in node against `testdata/office/busy.json` (built by `gen.cjs` beside it) for the drawers, the Apps block, the stuck crew, unknowns and the phone sheet.

A cabinet row's final state is in the reader's words, not the crew state machine's, which `crew list` and the console keep.
A `failed` task with a `failed_reason` is `didn't start`, the one red final state, with the reason as its tooltip.
Otherwise a reviewer shows its `review` however it was closed: `approved` (pass), `changes requested`, `review incomplete`, or `no verdict`.
Then a task the timeline saw merged is `merged`, a `failed` task is `discarded`, because closing with `--discard` is a decision rather than a fault, and any other `close_state` is shown as it is, `finished` for most.
A row shows its final state as a glyph only, one per state, with the word and why as its tooltip and accessible name, because the column is too narrow for `changes requested`; the summary above the table names each glyph with its count.

Each cabinet row, and each task in the cabinet's peek, starts with a glyph for its `role`: code brackets for a ship (coding), a compass for a scout, a checked clipboard for a review; its tooltip names the role, and a review names the task it reviewed. A row without `role` shows the unknown glyph rather than passing for a ship.

A crew wears a badge for each kind of agent it delegated to (`agents`, CON-124): under its state chip at its desk and in the hallway, after its name in the cabinet's peek, the cabinet rows and the daily board's task rows, on its phone card, and as an `Agents` line in the crew drawer (`none delegated to` when there are none). The badge is the kind as written - `backend-reviewer`, `ios-reviewer`, `Explore` - with "delegated to the … agent" as its tooltip and accessible name; the page does not know which agents a project defines, so it does not sort or colour them by kind. A crew that delegated to none wears none.

The Office filing cabinet includes a `Harness / model / effort` column. Harness comes from the recorded actor, model prefers `last_model` (observed) and falls back to `model` (requested launch setting), and `effort` is the requested launch setting retained in crew meta. These optional fields are omitted when unavailable; the cabinet displays `?` rather than guessing defaults. Requested effort is not proof of runtime effort. The cabinet is wider on desktop and its table scrolls horizontally on narrow screens.

## 12. Agent City

A third face on the same API, served at `/city/` from `internal/dashboard/ui/city/` (CON-125): the workspace as a 3D city, the same scene as the Agent City promo, built from the live API instead of a snapshot.
It is linked from the admin header (`Agent City`, beside `Mate Office`) and from the Office's view switch.

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `city.css` | the page: title, view switch, live pill, the tent panel and its feed |
| `app.js` | reads the API, keeps the city live, hover and click |
| `city.js` | the city: island, streets, City Hall, one block per project, one tent per repo, the setters `setCrews`, `setMate`, `setMerged`, `setBoard`, `setHall`, `setMailbox` |
| `room.js` | one tent up close, playing back its history |
| `history.js` | what a tent's agents did, read from the history endpoint |
| `chatter.js` | the small talk mascots say now and then, by pose |
| `agent-mascot.js`, `bubble.js`, `harnesses.js` | the AgentMascot component, as in the promo |
| `vendor/three.js` | three.js 0.186.1 and the addons the page uses, prebuilt into one ES module; its header carries the MIT licence and the command that built it |

The pages are ES modules rather than classic scripts, the one way this UI departs from section 10's letter; there is still no build step at serve time, no framework fetched and no CDN.
`TestUIMakesNoOffOriginRequest` walks the vendored file too: the only URLs in it are the XHTML and XLink namespaces `createElementNS` and `getAttributeNS` take as identifiers, exempt beside the SVG one.
`internal/dashboard/ui_city_test.go` proves the page is the embedded file, follows every relative `import` from `app.js` and checks each module is served as JavaScript, and checks both other UIs link here.

The city is a grid of blocks, 3×3 or 5×5 past eight projects, with City Hall at the centre; projects take the blocks in workspace order, the ones beside the hall first, and the blocks left over are parks. A workspace with more than 24 projects draws the first 24 and says how many it left out.

| Thing | From |
| --- | --- |
| a tent per repo | `repos` (section 2); a project with none gets one tent named after it |
| a tent's sign: `N merged` | ship tasks with a `merged_at` whose `repo` is the tent's (a task whose repo is unknown or no longer in `project.yaml` counts in the project's first tent); a rise pops the sign |
| the crews in a tent | the project's tasks whose scene `state` is not `gone`, posed by state: `at_desk_working` works, `walking_to_ceo`, `waiting_at_ceo` and `blocked` think, `asleep` sleeps, the rest stand idle; a new crew says its name, a changed state says a word |
| the Mate on the plaza | the card's `mate`: asleep when not running, else posed by `state` |
| the project's signboard | `/api/board?days=7` for the project: tokens, `closed.finished`, `reviews.pass`, tokens per task |
| City Hall's screen | each project: Mate running, crews not `gone`, tokens today (the board's last day, else the Mate's `tokens_today`) |
| the mailbox | news with `status` `new` or `waiting` across `/api/news`; the flag is up while there is any |

An unknown harness (one AgentMascot has no preset for) is a plain grey mascot with a ring for a logo, named after the harness.

Every mascot, in the city and in a tent, now and then says a line going round Vietnamese social media that fits its pose - working, thinking, idle, done or asleep - from `chatter.js`, every 12 to 34 seconds at random, and only when it is not already talking (CON-128). Small talk is for fun and says nothing about the work: it comes in a yellow bubble, never the paper one real lines use, and never in a tent's feed. In a tent it falls only where the mascot has said nothing real for a moment, one line at a time in the room, seeded by the crew's name so a rebuilt tent says the same lines at the same times; past the history it goes on while the tent is watched.

Hovering a mascot names it - crew and role, harness, model, effort, state - a tent its repo, merged count and crews at work, City Hall the inbox and the Mates' tokens today.
Clicking a crew opens `../office/#crew/<project>/<crew>`, a Mate `../office/#mate/<project>`, City Hall or its mailbox `../office/#captain`; the crew and Mate drawers there carry the action buttons (section 11).
Clicking a tent opens `#tent=<project>/<repo>`: the tent up close, playing back what its agents did (CON-127).
Its tasks are the project's rows on the tent spawned since midnight UTC seven days ago, or still open; a tent with no ship task among them takes its last three merged ship tasks and their reviews instead, and `since` moves back to the earliest spawn. Their lines are one read of section 4b with that `since`.
The playback is every task's spawn (or, for a reviewer, the Mate asking it to review), all its status lines, its questions and the answers, its hand-backs, each reviewer's verdict (`review` of the reviewer row; the reviewer's last hand-back is where it lands), and the merge, or the close of a task that was not merged, in the order they happened, one every 2.5 seconds whatever the real gap; the panel lists them with their real local times.
A crew sits at the round table from its spawn until just before the first event after its task closed; seats are reused, and past seven a second arc forms behind the first. The task board shows each ship task as it stood at that moment: `Doing` from its spawn, `Review` while a reviewer of it is at the table, `Done` once merged, with its latest status line or the PR.
The scrub bar under the tent runs from the first event to now, with the days and the merges marked: drag it, or click a line in the panel, to go there. Play runs at 1×, 4×, 16× or 64× until it reaches now; `Live` jumps to now and follows. A tent opens live, three events before now. Live and caught up, the open crews and the Mate end posed by their scene states, and a new event on the project reads the history again and plays it; scrubbed back, the view stays on the same event. `Space` plays and pauses.
A tent's mascots keep their whole timeline (AgentMascot's `keep`), so a pose or a line scrubbed back to is the one played there; by default a mascot drops what is more than ten seconds older than its newest.
The history is kept per tent while the project's rows are the same, and read ahead while the pointer rests on a tent, so a click opens it at once. A repo with no task shows a sleeping Mate.
`Escape` or `Back to the city` leaves the tent.

Reads: `/api/workspace`, `/api/projects/{p}` per project, `/api/board?days=7`, `/api/news`, and `/api/projects/{p}/history` for a tent.
The city is drawn as soon as `/api/workspace` answers; each project's crews and signs fill in as its page arrives, and the board and the news are read beside them and never hold the city up (CON-126).
It long-polls `/api/events?since=<last_event_id>&wait=20`; an answer with events re-reads the workspace and the pages of the projects they name, an id that went backwards (a `mate reindex`) re-reads every project, and every answer re-reads `/api/news` and, once it is five minutes old, `/api/board`. The pill says `live` or `stale` with the reason, and a failed poll retries every 3 seconds.
The page marks `city:drawn` and `city:tent <project>/<repo>` on the browser's performance timeline at the first frame of each.
The scene is one light palette whatever the system theme.
