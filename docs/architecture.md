# Architecture

What mate is made of once the fourth wave of the core split
(`refactor/con-203-wave-4`, 42c6571, 2026-11-05) is on `main`. Domain terms
(Mate, Crew, outbox, hand-back...) are defined in
[GLOSSARY.md](../GLOSSARY.md). `docs/mvp.md` is the history of how this came
to be; this file is the current map. Installing and building:
[install.md](install.md).

mate is splitting its core into a process of its own (CON-203). Done so far:
`internal/coreapi` (CON-206); the engine in `internal/core` (CON-207) with the
shared snapshot, Office/City and notifications (CON-208), the one entry
for every UI's actions (CON-209), a stop within one fixed bound
(CON-210), `mate core run` with `core.lock` (CON-211), and its clients'
API on `.mate/core.sock` with `internal/coreclient` (CON-212); the Mate's
and the Project's actions (CON-231); `mate core start|stop|restart|status`
and plain `mate` running the core (CON-213); `internal/refresh`
(CON-170); `internal/platform` (CON-184, CON-185); `CrewIsScout` in `store`
(CON-165); the CLI command table (CON-171); `internal/wake` (CON-169);
`internal/usage` (CON-168) and `--why` out of it in `internal/usage/why`
(CON-234); `internal/recall` (CON-167); the Herdr adapter
in `internal/runtime/herdr` (CON-190). Every
part marked **Target** below is planned, not built; the issue named beside it
owns the change. A PR that moves a package or a process updates the
paragraph it changes.

## 1. Packages by layer

Seven layers, lowest first. Every package with a non-test `.go` file under
`cmd/`, `internal/` and `assets/` belongs to exactly one, except the
test-only packages of rule 3. The Packages column decides: a package not
listed has no layer yet, and a subpackage does not inherit its parent's
layer (`harness` is read, `harness/claude` integration; `timeline/scene` and
`timeline/read` are read, `timeline` service). The "What belongs" column
describes the layer; it does not decide it. The same table is data in code,
`layers` in `internal/archtest/layers_test.go`, and the test keeps both
equal: a new package goes into both in one change, and the test's message
names the layers its imports and importers allow.

| Layer | What belongs | Packages |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 leaf (lá) | Types, rules, formats and OS shims that import no other layer | `assets`, `brief`, `capability`, `config`, `consolecmd`, `crewstate`, `memory`, `names`, `observability`, `platform`, `process`, `telemetry` |
| 2 storage (lưu trữ) | The workspace store and the database and config files beside it | `store`, `db`, `plugin`, `learnings` |
| 3 read (đọc) | Read models over stored state, and the ports they read through | `query`, `coreapi`, `box`, `timeline/scene`, `timeline/read`, `diagnostics`, `dispatch`, `harness`, `runtime` |
| 4 integration (tích hợp) | Adapters to something outside mate: harness CLIs, Herdr, the terminal host, git, `gh`, Jev, OS notifications | `harness/catalog`, `harness/claude`, `harness/codex`, `harness/grok`, `harness/pi`, `screen`, `screen/fixture`, `screen/jev`, `screen/chain`, `send`, `notice`, `host`, `panerun`, `gitx`, `github`, `facts`, `quota`, `teardown`, `notifications`, `matehost`, `coreclient`, `runtime/herdr` |
| 5 service (dịch vụ) | Application logic that combines the layers below, and the core that runs it | `spawn`, `outbox`, `autopilot`, `watch`, `timeline`, `recovery`, `refresh`, `prwatch`, `migrate`, `mateassets`, `hook`, `wake`, `recall`, `dashboard`, `usage`, `usage/why`, `core` |
| 6 UI (giao diện) | What the captain looks at; Office and City are web pages in `internal/dashboard/ui/`, served by `dashboard` (service) | `ui/console` |
| 7 binary | Wiring and CLI | `cmd/mate` |

Package paths are under `internal/` except `assets` and `cmd/mate`. Some
packages below storage still read or write a file under `.mate/` (section
3, Owner column); the layer follows the imports, not the file.

### Import rules

1. A package imports only packages of its own layer or a lower one. The rule
   reads non-test files, all build constraints included.
2. Placing a package (a guide for the table, not checked by itself): a port
   (an interface several layers use) sits at or below the lowest layer that
   imports it; its concrete adapters sit in integration. Today: `process` in
   leaf (it imports nothing of mate's); `runtime` (the `Adapter`/`ReadAdapter` port) in read, because
   `query` reads liveness through `runtime.ReadAdapter`, and its Herdr
   adapter `runtime/herdr` in integration; `harness` (the
   contract and Registry) in read, because `runtime` and `dispatch` import
   it; `screen` (the `Observer` port) in integration, because its lowest
   user is `send`.
3. Outside the rules: `_test.go` files, the test-only packages
   `brief/brieftest`, `harness/harnesstest` and `harness/codex/codexlab`
   (no non-test file imports them), and `scripts/`. `scripts/ptysmoke` is a
   module of its own (CON-183): `go list ./...` at the root does not reach
   it, and `make vet` vets it separately.
4. The boundary tests of section 4 add stricter local rules on top.

`internal/archtest/layers_test.go` checks rule 1 in `make check`: it fails
on a package with no layer, on an import that breaks the rule, and on a
line of `internal/archtest/violations.txt` that no longer happens. That
file is the list of today's violations, one import pair per line, each
either an exception (it stays; the design reason is on the line) or debt
(it must go, and `debtCeiling` in the test only goes down).

Packages that mix layers, until their issue splits them:

- `matehost` is the headless Mate host, the Mate's REPL (`repl*.go`, UI
  code) and the owner of `news.jsonl` and `work.jsonl`. The REPL is a
  client of the host's socket (CON-223): it reaches the host only through
  `matehost.Conn` (`REPLConn` over `host.sock`), never a `*Host`. The host
  runs outside Herdr and tells Herdr nothing (CON-225): `matehost` has no
  Herdr code.

`dashboard` is in service, not UI: it is the Office/City HTTP server the
engine runs (`internal/core/dashboard.go`), so `core` imports it, and it
reads `store`, `db`, `timeline` and `matehost` itself; its SQL is in
`timeline/read` (CON-166). The UI is the web
pages it serves. Since CON-165 it no longer imports `spawn`
(`store.Workspace.CrewIsScout`).

A package that uses the store without opening it takes an interface of its
own instead of `*store.Workspace`: `Workspace` in its `workspace.go`, the
methods it calls plus the interfaces of the packages it passes the
workspace to, and `var _ Workspace = (*store.Workspace)(nil)`
([plans/store-split-2026-11-06.md](plans/store-split-2026-11-06.md)
section 3, CON-238, CON-240, CON-241). `box`, `query`, `dashboard`,
`usage`, `usage/why`, `learnings`, `db` and `spawn`'s `CrewReader` (for
`ListCrews`) only read through theirs; `timeline`, `watch`, `autopilot`, `outbox`,
`prwatch` and `hook` name their writes in theirs. `cmd/mate`, the rest of
`spawn`, `core`, `recovery`, `refresh`, `migrate`, `wake` and `recall` keep
`*store.Workspace`. A store method writes when its name says so: a prefix
of `writePrefixes` in `internal/store/groups_test.go` (`Set`, `Append`,
`Write`...) followed by an upper-case letter or nothing, or an entry of
`writesWithoutPrefix` there (`TUIRunning`). Two tests of section 4 hold
this: the store's methods keep the naming rule, and the readers' interfaces
hold no write (CON-244).

`usage` (CON-168) builds the pages `mate usage` prints but `--why`: the
project's ledger, and a task's model calls per call or per session;
`cmd/mate/usage.go` only reads the flags. It is in service because the
ledger reads the crews through `spawn`. `usage/why` (CON-234) builds
`mate usage <p> <crew> --why` and writes the `## Usage (app)` section of a
crew's learning record when the crew closes (`why.RecordAtClose`,
CON-230), in the words of `--why`'s head. It reads through
`dashboard.Server`, so that page and the Task page cannot disagree. Their
reads of `mate.db` are in `timeline/read`; neither holds SQL. `usage`
imports nothing that reaches `dashboard` (`internal/usage/boundary_test.go`),
so `dashboard` can import `usage` to reuse the ledger; `usage/why` does not
import `usage`.

## 2. Processes and how they talk

| Process | Started by | Code | Runs |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Console | `mate console` (plain `mate` and `mate <dir>` run the core since 2026-11-06) | `runConsole`, `cmd/mate/console.go`; reaching the core in `cmd/mate/console_core.go` | One per workspace (flock on `.mate/console.lock`, CON-162). A client of the core (CON-214): runs no engine, reads the snapshot and sends actions over `.mate/core.sock`; starts the core when none answers, never stops it ([core.md](core.md#the-console)) |
| Core | `mate`, `mate <dir>`, `mate core run` (foreground); `mate core start` (background, CON-213) | `cmdCoreHere`, `cmdCoreRun`, `runCore`, `cmd/mate/core.go`; start/stop/status in `cmd/mate/core_control.go` | The engine, with or without a console: observer, timeline, outbox, auto daemon, recovery, Office/City and notifications, plus `.mate/core.sock` and the clients' routes on it (CON-212). Stops within the engine's bound on SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP. `start` runs `mate core run` in a session of its own with its output in `.mate/core.log`; `stop` sends SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 60 s, only to the pid `core.lock`'s holder wrote ([core.md](core.md)). With `MATE_PPROF=127.0.0.1:6060` in its environment it serves Go's profiles on that address, loopback only (CON-257, `cmd/mate/core_pprof.go`) |
| Pane runner | the console's host columns | `mate pane serve`, `internal/panerun` | One per sibling pane: the stage, and command tabs (a file review is a command tab); ends when the console's pid is gone. The stage runs `herdr agent attach --takeover` for a crew or a pane Mate, and the Mate REPL for a headless Mate (CON-224) |
| Herdr server | `herdr.Herdr` (`internal/runtime/herdr`), when the session it needs is not running | `herdr server --session <s>` (external) | Every agent pane: a pane Mate and every Crew. Outlives the console |
| Mate, pane mode | `spawn` | harness TUI in a Herdr pane | Claude Code calls `mate hook mate-prompt` / `mate-stop` (`internal/hook`). `mate.mode: pane`; a Mate runs only on a harness with headless turns (CON-236), so Codex and pi run Crews only |
| Mate, headless | `spawn` (`startHost`, `internal/spawn/headless.go`; `ExecHosts`, `hostproc.go`) | `mate mate-agent host <project> --no-repl`, `internal/matehost` (`Host.Live`) | One per headless Mate, a background process of its own outside Herdr (CON-225): its own session (`platform.StartNewSession`), no terminal, no tab or pane, stdout and stderr in `host.log`. Each turn is one `claude -p`. `mate.meta` records its `pid` and `socket`; whether it is alive is what `host.sock` answers (`spawn.HostLiveness`; a host that does not answer but still holds its host lock is alive and wedged). Runs until the `stop` op, SIGTERM or SIGHUP; a stop the op does not end sends SIGTERM, then SIGKILL, to the recorded pid, only while some process holds the host lock and no host answers under another pid. The escalation runs to its end even when the stop was cut short. The engine watches it (CON-226, `internal/core/hostwatch.go`): a host found dead in two looks 5 s apart, under the same `pid`, is started again on its session through `recovery.RestartHost`, at most 3 times in 10 minutes per Mate; the next death is left to the captain, with a notification and a notice. A stop drops `pid` from `mate.meta`, so a stopped Mate is not watched. Stopping the core sends the host nothing; recovery at the next engine start also brings back a host that died meanwhile. Run by hand in a terminal it runs the REPL as a child process, `mate mate-agent repl <project> --in-pane`. A host an older binary started in its Herdr pane keeps that pane, and Herdr answers for it, until its next restart. Each start also writes the `tui` script into the Mate's directory and opens, or finds, the Mate's shell pane in the workspace's Herdr session: a Herdr workspace and tab `mate-<project>-shell`, cwd the Mate's directory, no `MATE_*` variable (CON-227, `internal/spawn/mate_shell.go`); a stop leaves it open, and a restart of mate's own (recovery, the watch) opens it only in a session already running. Neither failing fails the start |
| Mate TUI | the captain: `./tui` in the Mate's directory (its shell pane), or `mate mate-agent tui <project>` in any terminal | `cmdMateTUI`, `cmd/mate/mate_tui.go`; `matehost.RunTUI`, `internal/matehost/tui.go` | A headless Mate's session in the harness's own TUI, for a while (CON-227): `claude` with the Mate's launch (`host.launch.json`) and `--resume <mate.meta's session_id>`, in the foreground of that terminal. It takes `.mate/tui.lock` (one per workspace), waits for the turn in flight and holds the Mate's turn lock until the TUI ends, however it ends; then, when the Mate's hooks recorded another session meanwhile, it writes it into `host.launch.json` and moves the host to it (`set-session`). The host stays alive and runs no turn meanwhile (`matehost.Options.Paused`), and the outbox tries none of the Mate's lines; every UI only looks (section 2). A `mate mate-agent tui` killed outright leaves the flag up while the Claude its record names (`harness_pid`) still runs (`store.TUIRunning`, Orphaned). Needs no core |
| Mate REPL | the console's stage; the captain, in any terminal | `mate mate-agent repl <project>`, `matehost.RunREPL` | A client of `host.sock` (CON-223): `subscribe` for events, `history` on each connection, one op per action; connects again on its own when the host restarts. Any number per Mate; they share the chat and the draft |
| Crew | `mate crew spawn` (`internal/spawn`) | harness TUI in a Herdr pane, in `.worktrees/<project>-<crew>` | Appends status lines to its `.status` file; stops in `wait-mate` to hand back |
| PR watcher | `mate pr watch` (`cmd/mate/pr.go`); `prwatch.Sweep` from recovery and the auto daemon | `internal/prwatch`, detached by `prwatch.ExecStarter` | One per crew pull request; on merge or close, queues a line in the outbox and delivers it itself |
| Read-only dashboard | `mate dashboard` | `cmdDashboard`, `cmd/mate/dashboard.go` | Office/City over `db.OpenRead`; the port is busy while a console or a core serves it |
| CLI commands | the Mate, a Crew or the captain | `commands()` table, `cmd/mate/dispatch.go` | Short-lived: `mate send`, `mate wake`, `mate news`, `mate merge`... Read and write `.mate/` directly, not through the console |

In `mate core run` (and in a console built before CON-214), `core.Engine`
(`internal/core/engine.go`, built by `engineOptions` in
`cmd/mate/console_auto.go`) first takes `.mate/core.lock` (CON-211): one
engine per workspace, wherever it runs; a second one gets
`core.RunningError` naming the holder's pid and owner (`core` or
`console`) and starts nothing. `mate core run` takes it
(`core.Lock`) before `engineOptions` builds the parts, whose observer opens
`mate.db`, and hand it in as `Options.Claim`. A core then binds `.mate/core.sock` (0600;
a socket left by a dead core is removed, a path too long or a filesystem
with no unix sockets stops it). It then starts, in order: the re-read
of `workspace.yaml` every 2 s (`internal/core/reload.go`); the observer
(`internal/watch`, a poll every 5 s) which records the timeline at the end of
each poll (`internal/timeline`); the outbox sender (`internal/outbox`, every
2 s); the auto daemon (`internal/autopilot`, every 90 s); recovery
(`internal/recovery`); the watch over the headless Mates' hosts
(`internal/core/hostwatch.go`, every 5 s, CON-226); the Office/City server (`internal/core/dashboard.go`);
the notification loop (`internal/core/notify.go`). `Stop` returns within
`core.StopWait` (45 s) plus the closing of `mate.db` (CON-210): it refuses
every new action (`coreapi.ErrStopping`, "mate core is stopping · nothing
started"; a page gets it as a 409), cancels every part, the snapshot being
computed and every action in flight (the pages' too) at once, then waits for
them all together under that one bound; the server's own shutdown takes at
most 5 s of it. It closes `mate.db` only once everything has stopped; past
the bound it names what still runs on stderr and leaves `mate.db` to the
process exit. `core.lock` is released last, or, past the bound, also left to
the process exit. A console quit in the middle of an action neither cancels
nor waits for it: the core runs it to its end (CON-214).

`Options.ConsolePresent` says whether a console is open: for `mate core
run`, true while a request saying
`X-Mate-Client: console` (`coreapi.ClientHeader`) reached its socket in the
last 10 s (`core.ConsoleSeen`, CON-212). Only the outbox loop reads it
(`outbox.Deps.ConsolePresent`, wired by `engineOptions`): with no console it types nothing into a Manual
project's Mate (a digest at the head is still withdrawn), while an Auto
project gets its lines, digests and refreshes as before; `Attempt` called
by itself (`assign`, `mate pr watch`) is not gated. The auto daemon does
not read it: `Sweep`, the budgets and M21's rearm run either way (CON-203,
decided 2026-11-05).

`Engine.Snapshot` (`internal/core/snapshot.go`) is the one `query.Snapshot`
every UI reads: `query.LoadLive` plus what the loops know, kept for up to
2 s, computed only when someone reads. `Engine.FreshSnapshot` skips the
cache (the button check of `POST /api/actions`); `Engine.Invalidate` drops
it after an action. The console TUI (`internal/ui/console`) reads it every
2 s through `coreapi.LoadFunc` (`consoleLoad` adds the console's own keys)
and acts through `coreapi.ActionFunc`: `Engine.Act` (`internal/core/act.go`).

`Engine.Act` is the one entry for an action from any UI: the console's
keys (`tuiAction`, `cmd/mate/console.go`, over the socket) and every
`POST /api/actions` of Office and City. It runs every action itself. The
chat (`say`, `interrupt`, `answer`, `fork`, `fork_close`, `undo`) runs on
the headless Mate's host. Every other action has its body in
`internal/core` (`ownAction`), over `Options.Workspace` and
`Options.Spawn`: the Mate's and the Project's (`act_mate.go`,
`act_project.go`, CON-231: `start`, `resume`, `onboard`, `stop` of a
Mate, `repair`, `mode`, `restart_mate`, `clear_composer`,
`remove_project`, `open_news`, `open_work`, `okay_work`), a crew's
(`act_crew.go`: `stop` of a crew, `restart_crew`, `diff`, `merge`), the
box's (`act_box.go`: `resolve`, `reply`, `peek`) and Jev's
(`act_notice.go`: `explain_notice`, CON-232). `explain_notice` asks
`Options.Notice`, the Jev client `mate core` builds from `.mate/.env`
(`cmd/mate/jev.go`); with Jev off it is nil, the pages do not offer the
action, `GET /api/core` says `jev: false`, and `explain_notice` is refused
as "explain_notice is not wired in this build". For its actions `mate core`
passes the engine `Workspace`, `Spawn` and `Notice`, no action function;
`Options.Act` is only a test's stand-in for every action but the chat
and a tick the Mate's host takes.
A restart held for the captain's second press (`restartHolds`) is the
engine's, in memory only: any UI confirms it, and only a new engine
forgets it.

While a Mate's TUI is open (CON-227, `.mate/tui.lock` held) `Engine.Act`
refuses every action but `peek` and `close_tui` with a
`*coreapi.TUIError` ("Mate shop đang mở TUI (pid 4242, từ 09:30) ·
nothing started"; `coreapi.ErrTUI`, code `tui`), before it takes any
lock, whatever the Project: every UI only looks. The snapshot carries the
flag (`query.Snapshot.TUI`); Office and City turn every button but Peek
off with "Mate <p> đang mở TUI" (`dashboard`'s `viewOnly`), and the
console asks the captain whether to close the TUI when it opens and when
the flag goes up while it is open (`cmd/mate/console_tui.go`).
`close_tui` (`internal/core/act_tui.go`) sends SIGTERM to the pid the
lock's holder wrote, which passes it to the TUI (to the harness itself
when that holder is gone), and waits up to 10 s for the flag to go. The
engine's loops run on.

`Engine.Act` holds one lock per target while an action runs: the
Project, `project/crew` when the request names a crew, the workspace for
adding a Project; the chat,
`peek`, `explain_notice`, `okay_work`, `open_news` and `open_work` take
`<target>#<action>` instead, so they run beside a stop or a merge. A
second action on a held target, from any UI, is refused with
`coreapi.ErrBusy` ("Action refused: … is still running on … · nothing
started"; a page gets it as a 409). Each console still runs one action at
a time of its own. After every action `Act` calls `Invalidate`.

How processes exchange state:

- **Files under `.mate/`.** The main channel. mate's own log appends
  (`.status`, `sent.log`, `incidents.log`; a Crew's `echo` takes no lock)
  and the read-modify-writes of the outbox,
  news, work, backlog and notifications logs take an advisory `flock`
  through `internal/platform` (`platform.Lock`, `platform.TryLock`); every
  such lock fails where flock is missing (CON-177). `.meta` files and
  `workspace.yaml` are replaced whole (temp file, then rename) with no
  cross-process lock: `store.Workspace.UpdateCrewMeta` re-reads and
  rewrites, so two processes updating one meta can lose an update.
  Section 3 lists the files.
- **SQLite, one writer.** `.mate/mate.db` is derived from the files and can
  be rebuilt (`mate reindex`). `db.Open` takes `.mate/mate.db.lock`; a second
  writer gets `db.ErrLocked` (a console then observes without recording).
  Readers use `db.OpenRead`.
- **Unix sockets.** `.mate/projects/<p>/mate/host.sock`: one JSON request
  and one JSON response per connection (`matehost.Client`), except
  `subscribe`, which keeps the connection and streams every host event as
  one JSON line (CON-221); the outbox delivers to a headless Mate through
  it (`OpDeliver`), spawn, Office chat and City ask it for state,
  history and answers, and every Mate REPL is a client of it (CON-223).
  Its `ping` is the headless Mate's liveness (CON-225): the snapshot
  (`spawn.HostLiveness` into `query.Liveness.Hosts`), recovery, `mate
  project remove`, `mate migrate` and `mate mate-agent status` ask it, never
  Herdr.
  What the captain sends through it from any UI (`submit`, `answer`,
  `work-okay`) the host holds `matehost.UndoDelay` before it runs, and
  `undo` takes it back (`internal/matehost/hold.go`, CON-222); the state
  and every event list what it holds. The console drives
  each pane runner over its own socket in a temp directory
  (`panerun.SocketDir`: `stage.sock`, `pane.sock`), not under `.mate/`.
- **Herdr.** `herdr.Herdr` (`internal/runtime/herdr`) runs the `herdr` executable (`process.Runner`)
  against the server's socket (`<config>/herdr/sessions/<s>/herdr.sock`):
  start, read, send keys, attach. `send.Send` types a line into a pane only
  after the fixture observer reads an empty composer; a send never asks Jev
  (`internal/screen/chain/chain.go`). The observer and the startup settle
  ask Jev only about a screen the fixture cannot read, when it is
  configured.
- **HTTP.** Office and City call the engine's server (`internal/dashboard`,
  default `127.0.0.1:7777`, LAN only with `allow_remote`). `mate core run`
  serves the same routes on `.mate/core.sock` too (`dashboard.ListenUnix`);
  a busy TCP port is said (and recorded as `tcp_error` in `core.lock`) and
  the core runs on the socket alone. The socket alone also serves the
  clients' routes (CON-212, `internal/dashboard/client.go`; over TCP each
  is a 404): `GET /api/core` (`coreapi.CoreStatus`: `core.lock`'s record,
  whether there is Jev, `Options.Notice` (CON-232), and the notices a console's
  status line shows), `GET /api/snapshot`
  (`Engine.Snapshot` in Go's default JSON, without `Commands`) and `POST
  /api/act` (a `coreapi.ActionRequest` run by `Engine.Act` under
  `context.WithoutCancel`, so it finishes when the client goes away; no
  re-check against a fresh snapshot, as the console's keys have none). A
  refusal is `{"error", "code"}` (`coreapi.ErrorBody`: 409 `busy`, 409
  `stopping`, 409 `tui` with the flag in `tui`, 422 `no_mate_repl`, 422 with no code for an action that
  failed, 503 for a snapshot that could not be read). `internal/coreclient`
  is the client: `Dial`, then `Core`, `Snapshot` (a `coreapi.LoadFunc`) and
  `Act` (a `coreapi.ActionFunc`), whose errors are coreapi's again
  (`errors.Is` finds `ErrBusy`, `ErrNoMateREPL`, `ErrStopping`). The
  socket is 0600 and `/api/act` takes the client's own text (a resolve's
  `Input`), which `POST /api/actions` never takes from a page; that is why
  it is not on TCP.

Names (2026-11-05, CON-216): **mate core** is the process that runs the
engine; **headless** is only how a Mate runs, one `claude -p` per message
in its host. Neither word stands for the other.

**Target** (CON-203): the `mate core` process runs the engine whenever the
workspace is in use (`mate`, or `mate core start|stop|restart|status`,
CON-213). UIs on this
machine reach it over `.mate/core.sock` through `internal/coreclient`
(built in CON-212); the console is such a client since CON-214, and closing
it leaves the engine, Office/City and notifications running. CLI commands
keep writing files directly.

## 3. State files in `.mate/`

Paths are relative to `.mate/`; `<p>` is a project, `<c>` a crew. Path
helpers are methods of `store.Paths` in `internal/store/layout*.go`:
`layout.go` for the workspace's own files, `layout_project.go`,
`layout_mate.go` and `layout_crew.go` for the rest. Every other file of
`internal/store` holds one responsibility group, listed in
`internal/store/doc.go` (CON-239). What only `mate migrate` does
(`migrate.lock`, `migrate.log`, rewriting a brief, writing layout 2) is a
method of `store.Migration`, which `ws.Migration()` returns, not of
`store.Workspace` (CON-242). `internal/store` says it is the
only package that touches `.mate/`; the Owner column shows where that is not
true yet. Splitting `store.Workspace` by responsibility, with narrow
interfaces on the side of each reader, is planned in
[plans/store-split-2026-11-06.md](plans/store-split-2026-11-06.md) (CON-173).

| `core.log`, `core.log.1` | `store` path | every core's output: `mate core start` points the core's output there, a foreground core (`mate`, `mate core run`) appends what it prints; either moves a log over 10 MB to `core.log.1` before opening it | the captain |
| `mate.db`, `mate.db.lock` | `db` | the timeline ingest in the engine; `mate reindex` | the engine's snapshot (tokens), dashboard, `mate events`, `mate usage`, `mate state`, `mate recall`, refresh; every query outside `db` and `timeline` is in `timeline/read` |

| `projects/<p>/mate/host.log`, `host.log.1` | `matehost` (path), `spawn` (rotation) | the headless host's stdout and stderr (CON-225); a start moves a log of `spawn.HostLogMax` (1 MiB) or more to `host.log.1` | the captain; a failed start quotes its last lines |
| `projects/<p>/mate/learnings/<c>.md` | `learnings` | the Mate; the app (`## Usage (app)` through `usage/why`, predictions) | `mate wake`, `mate learnings` |

Crews work in `.worktrees/<project>-<crew>`, git worktrees that `spawn`
creates and removes; `teardown` first stops what the worktree started.

## 4. Boundary tests

Each test fails `make check` when its rule breaks. The first four are the
ones CON-179 names; the next three came with CON-184, CON-206 and CON-207,
then one each with CON-190, CON-239, CON-244 and CON-234.
They add local rules to the repo-wide layer rule, which
`internal/archtest/layers_test.go` checks (section 1).

| Test | Rule |
| -- | -- |
| `internal/harness/ratchet_test.go` | Outside `internal/harness/...`, no non-test file names a harness: no import of a harness package, no harness-named identifier of package `harness`, no string literal that carries, as a whole token, a harness name or a name its profile declares (config directory, instruction file, env keys: `.claude`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX_HOME`). Ceiling 0; `ratchetAllow` lists three exceptions, each with a reason, and an entry that matches nothing fails |
| `internal/screen/ratchet_test.go` | Every `Observe` call in `send`, `spawn` and `outbox` is listed in `observeSites` with the deterministic check (string compare or highlight confirmation) that must follow it in the same function, or, for a helper, in each caller the entry names; a Jev reading alone never triggers an irreversible key |
| `internal/ui/console/boundary_test.go` | `internal/ui/console` imports none of `store`, `runtime`, `harness`, `process`, `box`, `send`, `spawn`, `watch`, `autopilot`, `outbox`, `host`, `core`, `coreclient`, `dashboard` (or their subpackages), nor any path containing `herdr`; test files included. It sees `query` types, the `coreapi` contract and closures from `cmd/mate` |
| `internal/ui/console/tool_keys_test.go` | Three lists are equal: `ownedKeys`, the keys the tree's handlers (`onKey`, `onListKey`, `onDetailKey`, `onBoxKey`) compare against in their source, and `consolecmd.ReservedKeys`; a key the console does not own reaches a configured tool from every pane |
| `internal/platform/ratchet_test.go` | Outside `internal/platform`, no `syscall.Flock`/`LOCK_*`/`O_NOFOLLOW`/`Kill`/`Getpgid`, `Setsid`/`Setpgid`, `runtime.GOOS`, import of `x/sys/unix` or `creack/pty`, or `"osascript"`, except the files in `platformAdapters` |
| `internal/coreapi/boundary_test.go` | `internal/coreapi` imports the standard library and `internal/query` only |
| `internal/core/boundary_test.go` | Nothing `internal/core` links, transitively, is under `cmd/` or `internal/ui/` |
| `internal/runtime/herdr/boundary_test.go` | Outside `internal/runtime/herdr`, only `internal/spawn` (which builds the live adapter in `LiveDeps`) imports it in a non-test file; the rest of mate reaches Herdr through `runtime.Adapter`, `runtime.ReadAdapter` and `runtime.SessionStream` |
| `internal/store/groups_test.go` | Every non-test file of `internal/store` that declares a method of `Workspace`, `Paths` or `Migration` is in one group of `methodGroups`; each method the table lists is in a file of its group; `workspace.go` declares no method; `Paths` methods are only in `layout*.go`, which hold no other method of these types and import only `fmt` and `path/filepath`. Since CON-244 each group has a kind (paths, records), and an exported method that writes the disk, directly or through the package's functions (calls matched by name), has a name that starts with a write prefix of `writePrefixes` followed by an upper-case letter, or is listed with a reason in `writesWithoutPrefix`; a path method has neither |
| `internal/archtest/store_readers_test.go` | For the readers of the store in `storeReaders` (`box`, `query`, `dashboard`, `usage`, `usage/why`, `learnings`, `db`, and `spawn.CrewReader`), type-checked against `go list -export` data: their interfaces, embedded ones included, have no method that writes by the store's rule, read from `internal/store/groups_test.go`; and, except in `spawn`, no non-test file holds a `*store.Workspace` outside `var _ Workspace = (*store.Workspace)(nil)` and the `noWorkspace` nil check, holds or calls through an interface that has a write of the store (a writer's `Workspace` included), or calls a function of `store` that writes or returns a `*store.Workspace` (`store.Open`, `store.Init`) |
| `internal/usage/boundary_test.go` | Nothing `internal/usage` links, transitively, is `internal/dashboard` or under it, so `dashboard` can import `usage` (CON-234); `--why`, which reads through `dashboard.Server`, is in `internal/usage/why` |

## 5. Where to make a change

**A harness.** Add `internal/harness/<name>` implementing `harness.Profile`
(`internal/harness/contract.go`: `Launcher`, `ScreenProfile`, and the optional
interfaces such as `MCPConfigurer` and `GracefulStopper`). Register it in
`catalog.Default` (`internal/harness/catalog/catalog.go`), the one list of
harnesses; in `cmd/` and `internal/`, only `cmd/mate` imports `catalog`. The contract suite in
`internal/harness/catalog/contract_test.go` then runs over it, and the
harness ratchet keeps its name out of every other package. Live tests use
`internal/harness/harnesstest`. Design: `docs/plans/harness-registry-2026-09-30.md`.

**A plugin.** No Go change: a directory with `mate-plugin.yaml`, installed in
`.mate/plugins.yaml` (`docs/plugins.md`). To change what a plugin can declare:
`internal/plugin` (`manifest.go`, `config.go`); it reaches the Mate at start
through `spawn` (`internal/spawn/plugins.go`), the console through
`cmd/mate/console_plugins.go`, Office through `internal/dashboard/plugins.go`,
and the CLI through `cmd/mate/plugin.go`.

**A terminal host.** Implement `host.Host` (`internal/host/target.go`) in a
new file beside `wezterm.go` and `ghostty.go`; add its `Kind` and detection
to `DetectFor` (`internal/host/detect.go`) and its case to `Open`
(`internal/host/open.go`). Code bound to one OS or one tool goes in
`platformAdapters` of `internal/platform/ratchet_test.go`, with a reason.
Panes it creates run `mate pane serve` (`cmd/mate/pane.go`).

**A CLI command.** Add one row to `commands()` in `cmd/mate/dispatch.go`
(names, one-line summary, handler, and `internal` for a command only mate
itself runs); dispatch and the usage text both come from that table, and
`cmd/mate/dispatch_test.go` checks every row is reachable and listed. A row's
`aliases` keep an old name working without usage showing it (`mate mate` for
`mate mate-agent`, CON-251). Put the
handler `cmdX` in `cmd/mate/<x>.go`, with only flag parsing and output there,
and the logic in an `internal/` package, as `internal/wake` does for
`mate wake` and `internal/recall` for `mate recall` (CON-164). A command the
Mate or a Crew uses must also be taught in its manual or skill under
`assets/mate/` or the brief template `assets/crew/brief.md.tmpl`. A console
key that runs a tool is not a CLI command: `.mate/console.yaml`,
`internal/consolecmd`, `docs/console-commands.md`.
