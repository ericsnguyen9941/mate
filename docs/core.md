# mate core

The core is a workspace's engine as a process of its own (CON-203): the
observer and the timeline, the outbox and the auto daemon, recovery, Mate
Office and Agent City, and the notifications. One engine runs per
workspace. `docs/architecture.md` section 2 says what the engine is made of;
this file is how to run it.

## Commands

Every command finds the workspace the way the other `mate` commands do: the
argument or `--workspace <dir>`, else `MATE_WORKSPACE`, else the nearest
directory above the current one that holds `.mate/`.

| Command | What it does |
| -- | -- |
| `mate`, `mate .`, `mate <dir>` | Runs the core in the foreground, like a dev server. Prints the block below, then the core's log. Ctrl+C stops it. |
| `mate core run [<dir>]` | The same. |
| `mate core start [<dir>]` | Runs the core in the background: in a session of its own, with no terminal, its output appended to `.mate/core.log`. Waits up to 10 s for it to answer on `.mate/core.sock`, then prints `mate core: started (pid N) · <url>`. |
| `mate core stop [<dir>]` | Sends the core SIGTERM and waits up to 60 s; a core still running then gets SIGKILL, and its socket is removed. |
| `mate core restart [<dir>]` | `stop`, then `start`. |
| `mate core status [<dir>]` | The pid, owner, version and build, start time, socket and the Office/City URLs. Exit 0 when an engine runs, 1 when none does. |
| `mate console [<dir>]` | Opens the console, a client of the core (CON-214): see "The console" below. |

`mate` opens no browser; it prints the URLs:

```
mate core · pid 4121 · ~/work/ws
Office  http://127.0.0.1:7777/office/
City    http://127.0.0.1:7777/city/
Herdr   mate-7b09de89
Log     /Users/me/work/ws/.mate/core.log
Ctrl+C to stop
```

`Herdr` is the workspace's Herdr session (`session:` in `workspace.yaml`),
the one `herdr session attach <name>` takes. `Log` is the absolute path of
`.mate/core.log`: in the foreground the core's output goes to the terminal
and is appended to that file too, so a core's log is in the same place
however it was started. `mate core status`, and `mate` beside a running
core, print both lines as well.

A dashboard that also reaches the LAN (`dashboard.allow_remote` in
`console.yaml`) adds a `LAN` line. When the port is taken the block says
`Office/City: 127.0.0.1:7777 is in use` instead of the two URLs, and the core
runs on its socket alone. Office and City always run while the core runs;
there is no flag to turn them off.

SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP stop the core within the engine's bound (45 s,
CON-210); a second signal ends it at once.

### When an engine already runs

| What runs | `mate`, `mate <dir>` | `mate core start` | `mate core stop` |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| nothing | runs the core | starts the core | `mate core: not running`, exit 0 |
| the core | prints `mate core: already running` and the status, exit 0 | `mate core: already running (pid N, since HH:MM)`, exit 0 | stops it |
| a console's engine (a console built before CON-214) | `mate: the engine runs inside mate console (pid N); quit that console first`, exit 1 | the same refusal, exit 1 | refuses: quit that console |

`mate core run` beside a running core says `already running` and exits 1.

## The console

`mate console` runs no engine (CON-214). It opens in this order:

1. It takes `.mate/console.lock` (one console per workspace, CON-162). A
   second console whose captain answers `N` exits and touches no core.
2. It connects to `.mate/core.sock`. With no core answering it starts one
   as `mate core start` does and waits up to 10 s; past that it says
   `mate console: mate core did not answer within 10s; see .mate/core.log`
   and exits 1.
3. It reads `GET /api/core`. A core of another build is asked about before
   the TUI draws: `mate core (pid N) runs a different build of mate.
   Restart it? [Y/n]`. `n` exits 1 with ``mate console: the console and mate
   core must be the same build; run `mate core restart` when ready``; any
   other answer restarts the core and opens. The snapshot crosses the
   socket as JSON by Go's field names, so the two must be one build.

The console reads `/api/snapshot` and `/api/core` every 2 s and sends its
actions to `/api/act`, each with `X-Mate-Client: console`. The core counts
a console as open for 10 s after its last request: with none, a Manual
project's queued outbox lines wait; an Auto project's are delivered either
way. The status line says the core's notices (`/api/core`); the URL of
Office/City in a terminal the console cannot split comes from there too.

Quitting the console stops no core. An action still running when the
console quits is neither cancelled nor waited for: the console says
`<action> keeps running in mate core`. When the core goes away while the
console is open, the header says `stale` and the console tries again every
2 s; it never starts the core again itself, so it does not race a `mate
core stop` that meant it. `.mate/console.yaml`'s `dashboard` and
`.mate/.env` (Jev) are read by the core when it starts: change them, then
`mate core restart`.

## How a command knows the core runs

Not by pid: the pid of a process that died may belong to another process by
now. The engine holds an advisory lock (flock) on `.mate/core.lock` for as
long as it runs, and the system releases it when the process ends, however
it ends. A command tries the lock without waiting: if it gets it (and lets go
at once), no engine runs; if not, one does, and the JSON in the file says
which process. A signal goes only to the pid the lock's current holder
wrote, and only while the lock is held. A `core.lock` left by a core that
died is therefore "not running": `stop` signals nobody, and `start` starts a
new core, which writes its own record over the old one.

## Files in `.mate/`

| File | What it is |
| -- | -- |
| `core.lock` | Held by the running engine. JSON: `pid`, `owner` (`core` or `console`), `started`, `version`, `binary`, `build` (sha256 of the binary when it started), `socket`, `url`, `lan_url`, `tcp_error`. The file stays after the engine ends. |
| `core.sock` | The core's unix socket (0600): Office/City's routes and the clients' API (`/api/core`, `/api/snapshot`, `/api/act`, CON-212). Removed when the core stops. |
| `core.log` | The output of every core: `mate core start` sends the core's output there, and a core in the foreground (`mate`, `mate core run`) appends what it prints to the terminal. Before it opens the log, either moves a log larger than 10 MB to `core.log.1`, keeping that one old log. The log of a core that is running is never rotated. |

## The headless Mates' hosts

A headless Mate's host is a process of its own (CON-225), not the core's:
stopping or restarting the core sends it nothing, and a turn in it runs on.
A core that starts finds each host alive on its socket and leaves it be.

While it runs, the core watches every host that `mate.meta` records
(`pid`, no pane) every 5 seconds (CON-226). A host found dead twice in a row,
under the same `pid`, is started again on its session through recovery:
under `.mate/recover.lock` first, then the action lock of its Project, and
only while `mate.meta` still records that `pid`. `core.log` gets a line:

```
mate core: Mate shop: host pid 4242 died; started again (1 of 3 in 10m), resumed its session
```

| Case | What the core does |
| -- | -- |
| The captain stopped the Mate | Nothing: the stop drops `agent`, `pid` and `socket` from `mate.meta`. |
| The host holds its host lock but does not answer | Nothing: it is alive and wedged; stop it. |
| A UI is stopping, starting or restarting that Mate | Nothing this time: that action decides. |
| A Mate in a Herdr pane (`mate.mode: pane`) | Nothing: Herdr reports it. |
| A Manual project | The same as an Auto one: starting the host types nothing into the Mate. |
| A fourth death within 10 minutes | Starts nothing more. A notification, unless `MATE_NOTIFICATIONS=off`, and the notice `Mate shop: host died 4 times in 10m; not restarting` on the console's status line, on the Mate's row and in `mate core status` (when the engine is the core's; a console's engine serves no socket to ask). |
| A host the core did not start (a start by hand, a UI's restart, recovery) | A new count, even before the core gave up. |

The count lives in the core's memory: a restarted core counts from zero, and
its recovery brings back a host that died meanwhile. `mate mate stop` and
`mate mate start` from a shell do not take the core's action lock: a stop
that lands in the instant the core restarts the same host can leave the new
host running, or have it started once more; stop again.

## After installing a new mate

A running core keeps running the binary it started from. `mate core status`
compares the sha256 of the file at `binary` with the `build` the core
recorded, and says

```
stale: the mate binary changed after this core started; run `mate core restart`
```

when they differ. `mate core restart` stops the old core and starts the
binary installed now. A core in the foreground is restarted with Ctrl+C and
`mate` again.

## mate reindex

`mate reindex` rebuilds `mate.db`, which the engine writes. Stop the core
first (`mate core stop`), run `mate reindex`, then start it again. While an
engine holds the timeline, `mate reindex` refuses and names that process.

## WSL2

- Keep the workspace on the Linux filesystem (under `~`), not under `/mnt/c`:
  the core serves a unix socket, and a Windows drive mounted in WSL2 may not
  hold one. A core that cannot bind its socket does not start.
- Office and City listen on `127.0.0.1` inside WSL2; Windows browsers reach
  them at the same URL while WSL's localhost forwarding is on (the default).
- WSL2 can shut the distribution down some time after its last terminal
  closes, and a core started with `mate core start` ends with it. Check with
  `mate core status` after reopening a terminal, or keep one terminal open.
