# External task management

Mate orchestrates agents. Choose any task manager and teach Mate its workflow
through `.mate/WORKSPACE.md`, `.mate/projects/<project>/PROJECT.md` or a
user-managed harness skill. No task manager, tracker directory, task-status
schema or task shortcut is installed by Mate. Without a chosen tracker, Mate
keeps requested work in its `backlog.md`.

## Setup for any application

1. Install/configure the application independently. Choose the tracker location
   or account/project explicitly; Mate's cwd is its own state folder, not the
   tracker. For a shared local tracker, a directory under the project and outside
   `.mate/`, code repos and Crew worktrees avoids losing it during teardown.
2. Put the workflow in the captain's instructions: the CLI/API or skill to read,
   how to find/create/assign tasks, allowed states, who updates them and when
   delivery is accepted. Include task IDs in briefs. Crew handback does not
   automatically change an external task.
3. If desired, add a console command binding using `mate console --help`.
   Opening the application's UI and teaching the agent its commands are
   separate settings. Mate neither initializes nor refreshes tracker data.
4. Test a read and a single authorized update with the application's own
   commands. Confirm the UI reflects it. Reopen the console after changing
   bindings; start/restart Mate to regenerate its built-in instructions.

## Local suggestion: Backlog.md

[Backlog.md](https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md) stores Markdown tasks locally
and provides a local web Kanban, forms, CLI/JSON and MCP. This is a user choice,
not a Mate dependency. The recommendation comes from official documentation
and source; installation and live usage have not been verified here.

```sh
npm i -g backlog.md
cd /absolute/path/to/workspace/my-project
backlog init "My project" --no-git
backlog instructions overview
backlog browser
```

The `--no-git` setup keeps the tracker filesystem-only without remote Git
operations or automatic commits. Use one tracker for the project, shared by
its repos. Set Mate as the sole dispatcher unless you have verified the chosen
tool's claim/concurrency behavior.

Add a prompt to that project's `PROJECT.md`, substituting the actual path:

```text
Task manager: Backlog.md at /absolute/path/to/workspace/my-project.
Run backlog commands with cwd at that directory and read
`backlog instructions overview` before managing tasks.
You own task assignment and status updates; Crew reports results to you.
Record the task ID in each Crew brief and mark work In Progress before dispatch.
Set Done only after accepted review and the change has landed, or the scout
deliverable has been accepted. Read a task again after a write conflict.
```

Optional board binding in `.mate/console.yaml`:

```yaml
bindings:
  - key: t
    scope: project
    label: board
    command: [backlog, browser]
    cwd: "{project_dir}"
    mode: terminal
```

This runs the long-lived local browser server in a managed terminal tab, so
quitting the console stops that server. `external` is for short GUI launchers;
use it to open an already-running board URL, not to run its server. No
application binding is supplied by Mate.

cover the installation, UI, storage and concurrency limits in more detail.

## Existing Beads users

The old `mate tool beads ...`, `mate beads`, `mate tasks` and `mate task-triage`
commands are gone. Console `t` and automatic task recall are gone unless you
configure your own command/workflow. Existing `.beads/` data, exports, legacy
`tasks.yaml` and lock files are left exactly where they are. This change does
not convert or delete any task records, and Mate never uninstalls `bd` or `bv`.

Before using a new Mate session, inspect the previously generated
`<workspace>/.mate/projects/<project>/mate/.claude/skills/task-management/SKILL.md`
if present (Claude and Codex used that location). If it still calls
`mate tool beads`, remove that obsolete generated skill or replace it with
your selected workflow using the application's own commands. Check captain
instructions and other custom skills for old wrapper references too. Mate
preserves custom skill files, so restarting alone will not remove that file.

If continuing to use Beads, configure its tracker path explicitly and follow
the installed `bd`/`bv` documentation. The previous Mate wrapper's locking and
export refresh no longer occur. If switching to another application, retain
the Beads store until you have verified an independent export/import and the
task counts, statuses and dependencies. No migration is performed here.
