// The observer's wiring (mvp.md task 18). It lives here, beside the
// Console's other seams, for the same reason they do: internal/query is
// file-only and internal/ui/console may reach neither Herdr nor
// internal/watch (its boundary test), so the one place that can build an
// observer over the live runtime is this package. What the observer saw is
// put into the snapshot by internal/core (CON-208).

// consoleWatcher builds the observer for an open workspace.
//
// It opens its own *store.Workspace over the same directory rather than
// sharing the Console's. A Workspace caches workspace.yaml and rewrites that
// cache on every LoadConfig - which query.Load does on every refresh, on the
// UI goroutine - while the observer polls on its own. Two handles over the
// same files cost one more yaml read per poll and remove the shared mutable
// state entirely; the files themselves are read and appended under flock.
//
// It records no timeline: a database handle holds an advisory lock for as
// long as it is open, so the one place that opens it is the one place that
// can close it. engineOptions uses consoleWatcherWithTimeline for that
// reason, and the engine it builds closes the handle (internal/core).
