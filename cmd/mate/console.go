Editor setup
1. Install your editor's CLI and check it in your terminal: code --version,
   zed --version, or your chosen editor's equivalent. For VS Code on macOS,
   use the Command Palette: "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH".
2. Create or edit <workspace-dir>/.mate/console.yaml, preserving any existing
   bindings. This is the workspace root, not the Mate's own working directory.

bindings:
  - key: e
    scope: crew
    label: report
    command: [code, --reuse-window, "{report_path}"]
    mode: external

For Zed, use command: [zed, "{report_path}"] with mode: external.
For a terminal editor, use command: [nvim, "{report_path}"] with mode: terminal.
Use an absolute executable path if the CLI is not on PATH.

3. Reopen the console, select a Crew row and press e. Press ? for key help.
   If report.md does not exist yet, the binding reports it; use {crew_dir}
   instead of {report_path} to open the Crew's folder, or {worktree_dir}
   for the code it is changing.

Available paths: {workspace_dir}, {project_dir}, {crew_dir}, {report_path},
{worktree_dir}. The last three require scope: crew. scope: project opens on a project row.
cwd defaults to the crew/project directory; a relative cwd uses workspace root.
command is an argv list, passed without a shell or environment expansion.
terminal opens/reuses a managed tab in WezTerm/Ghostty.
external launches a GUI without a host tab; omit --wait (10-second timeout).
No editor binding is installed by default. Keys reserved by the console or
already bound in the same scope are refused. Configuration loads at startup.
