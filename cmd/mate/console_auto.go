// The Mate's delivery wiring (mvp.md tasks 19 and 30), and engineOptions,
// which hands it, the observer and recovery to internal/core's engine
// (CON-207). They sit beside the observer's wiring in console_watch.go, and
// for the same reason: internal/query is file-only and internal/ui/console
// may reach neither Herdr, internal/outbox nor internal/autopilot (its
// boundary test), so this package is the one place that can hold both a
// live runtime and a snapshot.

// engineOptions builds the parts internal/core's engine runs for an open
// workspace (CON-207): the observer with the timeline it records, the outbox
// sender and the auto daemon, and recovery; and what its snapshot asks Herdr
// through (CON-208). The console runs them under an engine for as long as
// it is open, and `mate core run` for as long as it runs (CON-211); each
// adds the dashboard and the notifications. consolePresent is
// core.Options.ConsolePresent, which the outbox loop asks before it types
// into a Manual project's Mate. The builders stay in this package, beside
// the commands that build the same parts for one shot of their own
// (spawn.MateOutbox, consoleSessionRef, mateRefresher).
//
// Every loop shares ws, the engine's own handle (CON-270): the engine reads
// workspace.yaml back into it on a `workspace` notice and when the file
// changes, so the observer, the outbox loop and the auto daemon no longer
// read the file each pass (their Deps.SharedConfig). Since CON-204 a
// handle's configuration is swapped whole, so sharing it is safe, and a
// change the engine or a loop makes is seen by all of them at once.
// Recovery repairs ws, and the snapshot and the dashboard read it.
