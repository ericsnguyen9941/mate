// A ship crew that has handed back - `pr-open`, or `wait-mate` for a local
// ship - is resting (CON-73). The Mate's next message to it is a fix
// round, and a fix round in the old session runs on everything that
// session has read: on hellovietnam that was 250-434k of context per call
// and two to three times the tokens the first round cost. So `mate send`
// and `mate brief append` open a fresh session for a resting crew instead
// of typing into its pane: spawn.RelaunchCrew with a spawn.FreshSession,
// whose opening input is the brief, the last hand-back, the message and
// the diff since the last review. `--same-session` is the captain's way
// to type into the old pane anyway.

// restingCrew reports whether the crew is resting: a ship whose latest
// status line hands the work back and was written in its current session
// (at or past the status offset the last fresh relaunch recorded, so a
// message right after a relaunch reaches the new pane rather than opening
// a third session). It returns the verb that line was written with. A
// scout never rests: its hand-back is its report, and a message to it is a
// follow-up question, not a fix round.
